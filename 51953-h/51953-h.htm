      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>AKLEY was alone in
      the bare general offices of the Huckleberry line-as the Buckhom and
      Antioch Railroad was commonly called by the public, which it betrayed in
      the matter of meals and connections. He was lolling lazily over his desk
      with a copy of the local paper before him, and the stem of a disreputable
      cob pipe between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business of the day was done, and the noise and hurry attending its
      doing had given way to a sudden hush. Other sounds than those that had
      filled the ear since morning grew out of the stillness. Big drops of rain
      driven by the wind splashed softly against the unpainted pine door which
      led into the yards, or fell with a gay patter on the corrugated tin roof
      overhead. No. 7, due at 5.40, had just pulled out with twenty minutes to
      make up between Antioch and Harrison, the western terminus of the line.
      The six-o'clock whistle had blown, and the men from the car shops, a
      dingy, one-story building that joined the general offices on the east,
      were straggling off home. Across the tracks at the ugly little depot the
      ticket-agent and telegraph-operator had locked up and hurried away under
      one umbrella the moment No. 7 was clear of the platform. From the yards
      every one was gone but Milton McClintock, the master mechanic, and Dutch
      Pete, the yard buss. Protected by dripping yellow oil-skins, they were
      busy repairing a wheezy switch engine that had been incontinently backed
      into a siding and the caboose of a freight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley was waiting the return of Clarence, the office-boy, whom he had
      sent up-town to the post-office. Having read the two columns of local and
      personal gossip arranged under the heading &ldquo;People You Know,&rdquo; he swept his
      newspaper into the wastebasket and pushed back his chair. The window
      nearest his desk overlooked the yards and a long line of shabby day
      coaches and battered freight cars on one of the sidings. They were there
      to be rebuilt or repaired. This meant a new lease of life to the shops,
      which had never proved profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley had been with the Huckleberry two months. The first intimation the
      office force received that the new man whom they had been expecting for
      over a week had arrived in Antioch, and was prepared to take hold, was
      when he walked into the office and quietly introduced himself to Kerr and
      Holt. Former general managers had arrived by special after much
      preliminary wiring. The manner of their going had been less spectacular.
      They one and all failed, and General Cornish cut short the days of their
      pride and display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally the office had been the least bit skeptical concerning Oakley
      and his capabilities, but within a week a change was patent to every one
      connected with the road: the trains began to regard their schedules, and
      the slackness and unthrift in the yards gave place to an ordered
      prosperity. Without any apparent effort he found work for the shops, a few
      extra men even were taken on, and there was no hint as yet of half-time
      for the summer months.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a broad-shouldered, long-limbed, energetic young fellow, with frank
      blue eyes that looked one squarely in the face. Men liked him because he
      was straightforward, alert, and able, with an indefinite personal charm
      that lifted him out of the ordinary. These were the qualities Cornish had
      recognized when he put him in control of his interests at Antioch, and
      Oakley, who enjoyed hard work, had earned his salary several times over
      and was really doing wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put down his pipe, which was smoked out, and glanced at the clock.
      &ldquo;What's the matter with that boy?&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter was that Clarence had concluded to take a brief vacation. After
      leaving the post-office he skirted a vacant lot and retired behind his
      father's red barn, where he applied himself diligently to the fragment of
      a cigarette that earlier in the day McClintock, to his great scandal, had
      discovered him smoking in the solitude of an empty box-car in the yards.
      The master mechanic, who had boys of his own, had called him a runty
      little cuss, and had sent him flying up the tracks with a volley of bad
      words ringing in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cigarette was finished, the urchin bethought him of the purpose
      of his errand. This so worked upon his fears that he bolted for the office
      with all the speed of his short legs. As he ran he promised himself,
      emotionally, that &ldquo;the boss&rdquo; was likely to &ldquo;skin&rdquo; him. But whatever his
      fears, he dashed into Oakley's presence, panting and in hot haste. &ldquo;Just
      two letters for you, Mr. Oakley!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;That was all there was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went over to the superintendent and handed him the letters. Oakley
      observed him critically and with a dry smile. For an instant the boy hung
      his head sheepishly, then his face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's an awfully wet day; it's just sopping!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley waived this bit of gratuitous information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you run all the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep, every step,&rdquo; with the impudent mendacity that comes of long
      practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's rather curious you didn't get back sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarence looked at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I gone long? It didn't seem long to me,&rdquo; he added, with a candor he
      intended should disarm criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a little over half an hour, Clarence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The superintendent sniffed suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;McClintock says he caught you smoking a cigarette to-day&mdash;how about
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cubebs,&rdquo; in a faint voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The superintendent sniffed again and scrutinized the boy's hands, which
      rested on the corner of his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that on your fingers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarence considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That? Why, that must be walnut-stains from last year. Didn't you ever get
      walnut-stains on your hands when you was a boy, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so, but I don't remember that they lasted all winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarence was discreetly silent. He felt that the chief executive of the
      Huckleberry took too great an interest in his personal habits. Besides, it
      was positively painful to have to tell lies that went so wide of the mark
      as his had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you may as well go home now. But I wouldn't smoke any more
      cigarettes, if I were you,&rdquo; gathering up his letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Mr. Oakley,&rdquo; with happy alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Clarence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door into the yards closed with a bang, and Clarence, gleefully
      skipping the mud-puddles which lay in his path, hurried his small person
      off through the rain and mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley glanced at his letters. One he saw was from General Cornish. It
      proved to be a brief note, scribbled in pencil on the back of a telegram
      blank. The general would arrive in Antioch that night on the late train.
      He wished Oakley to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other letter was in an unfamiliar hand. Oakley opened it. Like the
      first, it was brief and to the point, but he did not at once grasp its
      meaning. This is what he read:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;DEAR Sir,&mdash;I enclose two newspaper clippings which fully explain
      themselves. Your father is much interested in knowing your whereabouts. I
      have not furnished him with any definite information on this point, as I
      have not felt at liberty to do so. However, I was able to tell him I
      believed you were doing well. Should you desire to write him, I will
      gladly undertake to see that any communication you may send care of this
      office will reach him.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Very sincerely yours,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Ezra Hart.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a bolt from a clear sky. He drew a deep, quick breath. Then he
      took up the newspaper clippings. One was a florid column-and-a-half
      account of a fire in the hospital ward of the Massachusetts State prison,
      and dealt particularly with the heroism of Roger Oakley, a life prisoner,
      in leading a rescue. The other clipping, merely a paragraph, was of more
      recent date. It announced that Roger Oakley had been pardoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley had scarcely thought of his father in years. The man and his
      concerns&mdash;his crime and his tragic atonement&mdash;had passed
      completely out of his life, but now he was free, if he chose, to enter it
      again. There was such suddenness in the thought that he turned sick on the
      moment; a great wave of self-pity enveloped him, the recollection of his
      struggles and his shame&mdash;the bitter, helpless shame of a child&mdash;returned.
      He felt only resentment towards this man whose crime had blasted his
      youth, robbing him of every ordinary advantage, and clearly the end was
      not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, by degrees, he had grown away from the memory of it all. He had long
      since freed himself of the fear that his secret might be discovered. With
      success, he had even acquired a certain complacency. Without knowing his
      history, the good or the bad of it, his world had accepted him for what he
      was really worth. He was neither cowardly nor selfish. It was not alone
      the memory of his own hardships that embittered him and turned his heart
      against his father. His mother's face, with its hunted, fugitive look,
      rose up before him in protest. He recalled their wanderings in search of
      some place where their story was not known and where they could begin life
      anew, their return to Burton, and then her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years it had been like a dream, and now he saw only the slouching
      figure of the old convict, which seemed to menace him, and remembered only
      the evil consequent upon his crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he fell to wondering what sort of a man this Roger Oakley was who had
      seemed so curiously remote, who had been as a shadow in his way preceding
      the presence, and suddenly he found his heart softening towards him. It
      was infinitely pathetic to the young man, with his abundant strength and
      splendid energy; this imprisonment that had endured for almost a quarter
      of a century. He fancied his father as broken and friendless, as dazed and
      confused by his unexpected freedom, with his place in the world forever
      lost. After all, he could not sit in judgment, or avenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as he knew he had never seen his father but once. First there had
      been a hot, dusty journey by stage, then he had gone through a massive
      iron gate and down a narrow passage, where he had trotted by his mother's
      side, holding fast to her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this came back in a jerky, disconnected fashion, with wide gaps and
      lapses he could not fill, but the impression made upon his mind by his
      father had been lasting and vivid. He still saw him as he was then, with
      the chalky prison pallor on his haggard face. A clumsily made man of
      tremendous bone and muscle, who had spoken with them through the bars of
      his cell-door, while his mother cried softly behind her shawl. The boy had
      thought of him as a man in a cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered who Ezra Hart was, for the name seemed familiar. At length he
      placed him. He was the lawyer who had defended his father. He was puzzled
      that Hart knew where he was; he had hoped the little New England village
      had lost all track of him, but the fact that Hart did know convinced him
      it would be quite useless to try to keep his whereabouts a secret from his
      father, even if he wished to. Since Hart knew, there must be others, also,
      who knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the newspaper clippings again. By an odd coincidence they had
      reached him on the very day the Governor of Massachusetts had set apart
      for his father's release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, in the yards, on the drenched town, and in the sweating fields
      beyond, the warm spring rain fell and splashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fit time for Roger Oakley to leave the gray walls, and the gray
      garb he had worn so long, and to re-enter the world of living things and
      the life of the one person in all that world who had reason to remember
      him.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>AKLEY drew down
      the top of his desk and left the office. Before locking the door, on which
      some predecessor had caused the words, &ldquo;Department of Transportation and
      Maintenance. No admittance, except on business,&rdquo; to be stencilled in black
      letters, he called to McClintock, who, with Dutch Pete, was still fussing
      over the wheezy switch-engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you want in the office for anything, Milt?&rdquo; The master-mechanic, who
      had been swearing at a rusted nut, got up from his knees and, dangling a
      big wrench in one hand, bawled back: &ldquo;No, I guess not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's the job coming on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About finished. Damn that fool Bennett, anyhow! Next time he runs this
      old bird-cage into a freight, he'll catch hell from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After turning the key on the Department of Transportation and Maintenance,
      Oakley crossed the tracks to the station and made briskly off up-town,
      with the wind and rain blowing in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived at the American House, the best hotel the place could boast. It
      overlooked the public square, a barren waste an acre or more in extent,
      built about with stores and offices; where, on hot summer Saturdays,
      farmers who had come to town to trade, hitched their teams in the deep
      shade of the great maples that grew close to the curb. Here, on Decoration
      Day and the Fourth of July, the eloquence of the county assembled and
      commuted its proverbial peck of dirt in favor of very fine dust. Here,
      too, the noisiest of brass-bands made hideous hash of patriotic airs, and
      the forty odd youths constituting the local militia trampled the shine
      from each other's shoes, while their captain, who had been a sutler's
      clerk in the Civil War, cursed them for a lot of lunkheads. And at least
      once in the course of each summer's droning flight the spot was abandoned
      to the purely carnal delights of some wandering road circus.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, Antioch had its own life and interests, after the manner of
      every other human ant-hill; and the Honorable Jeb Barrow's latest public
      utterance, Dippy Ellsworth's skill on the snare-drum, or &ldquo;Cap&rdquo; Roberts's
      military genius, and whether or not the Civil War would really have ended
      at Don-elson if Grant had only been smart enough to take his advice, were
      all matters of prime importance and occupied just as much time to weigh
      properly and consider as men's interests do anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Antioch, Oakley was something of a figure. He was the first manager of
      the road to make the town his permanent headquarters, and the town was
      grateful. It would have swamped him with kindly attention, but he had
      studiously ignored all advances, preferring not to make friends. In this
      he had not entirely succeeded. The richest man in the county, Dr. Emory,
      who was a good deal of a patrician, had taken a fancy to him, and had
      insisted upon entertaining him at a formal dinner, at which there were
      present the Methodist minister, the editor of the local paper, the
      principal merchant, a judge, and an ex-Congressman, who went to sleep with
      the soup and only wakened in season for the ice-cream. It was the most
      impressive function Oakley had ever attended, and even to think of it
      still sent the cold chills coursing down his spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning he had chanced to meet Dr. Emory on the street, and the
      doctor, who could always be trusted to say exactly what he thought, had
      taken him to task for not calling. There was a reason why Oakley had not
      done so. The doctor's daughter had just returned from the East, and vague
      rumors were current concerning her beauty and elegance. Now, women were
      altogether beyond Oakley's ken. However, since some responsive courtesy
      was evidently expected of him, he determined to have it over with at once.
      Imbued with this idea, he went to his room after supper to dress. As he
      arrayed himself for the ordeal, he sought to recall a past experience in
      line with the present. Barring the recent dinner, his most ambitious
      social experiment had been a brakesmen's ball in Denver, years before,
      when he was conductor on a freight. He laughed softly as he fastened his
      tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what Dr. Emory would think if I told him I'd punched a fellow at
      a dance once because he wanted to take my girl away from me.&rdquo; He recalled,
      as pointing his innate conservatism, that he had decided not to repeat the
      experiment until he achieved a position where a glittering social success
      was not contingent upon his ability to punch heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still raining, a discouragingly persistent drizzle, when Oakley
      left his hotel and turned from the public square into Main Street. This
      Main Street was never an imposing thoroughfare, and a week of steady
      downpour made it from curb to curb a river of quaking mud. It was lit at
      long intervals by flickering gas-lamps that glowed like corpulent
      fireflies in the misty darkness beneath the dripping maple-boughs. As in
      the case of most Western towns, Antioch had known dreams of greatness,
      dreams which had not been realized. It stood stockstill, in all its raw,
      ugly youth, with the rigid angularity its founders had imposed upon it
      when they hacked and hewed a spot for it in the pine-woods, whose stunted
      second growth encircled it on every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emory home had once been a farm-house of the better class; various
      additions and improvements gave it an air of solid and substantial comfort
      unusual in a community where the prevailing style of architecture was a
      square wooden box, built close to the street end of a narrow lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor himself answered Oakley's ring, and led the way into the
      parlor, after relieving him of his hat and umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife you know, Mr. Oakley. This is my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance Emory rose from her seat before the wood fire that smoldered on
      the wide, old-fashioned hearth, and gave Oakley her hand. He saw a
      stately, fair-haired girl, trimly gowned in an evening dress that to his
      unsophisticated gaze seemed astonishingly elaborate. But he could not have
      imagined anything more becoming. He decided that she was very pretty.
      Later he changed his mind. She was more than pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      For her part, Miss Emory saw merely a tall young fellow, rather
      good-looking than otherwise, who was feeling nervously for his cuffs.
      Beyond this there was not much to be said in his favor, but she was
      willing to be amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been absent from Antioch four years. These years had been spent in
      the East, and in travel abroad with a widowed and childless sister of her
      father's. She was, on the whole, glad to be home again. As yet she was not
      disturbed by any thoughts of the future. She looked on the world with
      serene eyes. They were a limpid blue, and veiled by long, dark lashes. She
      possessed the poise and unshaken self-confidence that comes of position
      and experience. Her father and mother were not so well satisfied with the
      situation; they already recognized that it held the elements of a tragedy.
      In their desire to give her every opportunity they had overreached
      themselves. She had outgrown Antioch as surely as she had outgrown her
      childhood, and it was as impossible to take her back to the one as to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor patted Oakley on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you've dropped in. I hope, now you have made a beginning, we
      shall see more of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a portly man of fifty, with kindly eyes and an easy, gracious
      manner. Mrs. Emory was sedate and placid, a handsome, well-kept woman, who
      administered her husband's affairs with a steadiness and economy that had
      made it possible for him to amass a comfortable fortune from his
      straggling country practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance soon decided that Oakley was not at all like the young men of
      Antioch as she recalled them, nor was he like the men she had known while
      under her aunt's tutelage&mdash;the leisurely idlers who drifted with the
      social tide, apparently without responsibility or care.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proved hopelessly dense on those matters with which they had been
      perfectly familiar. It seemed to her that pleasure and accomplishment, as
      she understood them, had found no place in his life. The practical quality
      in his mind showed at every turn of the conversation. He appeared to
      hunger after hard facts, and the harder these facts were the better he
      liked them. But he offended in more glaring ways. He was too intense, and
      his speech too careful and precise, as if he were uncertain as to his
      grammar, as, indeed, he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Oakley was vaguely aware that he was not getting on, and the strain
      told. It slowly dawned upon him that he was not her sort, that where he
      was concerned, she was quite alien, quite foreign, with interests he could
      not comprehend, but which gave him a rankling sense of inferiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been moderately well satisfied with himself, as indeed he had good
      reason to be, but her manner was calculated to rob him of undue pride; he
      was not accustomed to being treated with mixed indifference and patronage.
      He asked himself resentfully how it happened that he had never before met
      such a girl. She fascinated him. The charm of her presence seemed to
      suddenly create and satisfy a love for the beautiful. With generous
      enthusiasm he set to work to be entertaining. Then a realization of the
      awful mental poverty in which he dwelt burst upon him for the first time.
      He longed for some light and graceful talent with which to bridge the wide
      gaps between the stubborn heights of his professional erudition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was profoundly versed on rates, grades, ballast, motive power, and
      rolling stock, but this solid information was of no avail He could on
      occasion talk to a swearing section-boss with a grievance and a brogue in
      a way to make that man his friend for life; he also possessed the happy
      gift of inspiring his subordinates with a zealous sense of duty, but his
      social responsibilities numbed his faculties and left him a bankrupt for
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others gave him no assistance. Mrs. Emory, smiling and good-humored,
      but silent, bent above her sewing. She was not an acute person, and the
      situation was lost upon her, while the doctor took only the most casual
      part in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley was wondering how he could make his escape, when the door-bell
      rang. The doctor slipped from the parlor. When he returned he was not
      alone. He was preceded by a dark young man of one or two and thirty. This
      was Griffith Ryder, the owner of the Antioch <i>Herald</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Mr. Ryder.&rdquo; Ryder shook hands with the two ladies,
      and nodded carelessly to Oakley; then, with an easy, graceful compliment,
      he lounged down in a chair at Miss Emory's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance had turned from the strenuous Oakley to the new-comer with a
      sense of unmistakable relief. Her mother, too, brightened visibly. She did
      not entirely approve of Ryder, but he was always entertaining in a lazy,
      indifferent fashion of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Griff,&rdquo; the doctor said, &ldquo;that you are going to support Kenyon. I
      declare it shakes my confidence in you,&rdquo; And he drew forward his chair.
      Like most Americans, the physician was something of a politician, and, as
      is also true of most Americans, not professionally concerned in the hunt
      for office, this interest fluctuated between the two extremes of party
      enthusiasm before and non-partisan disgust after elections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryder smiled faintly. &ldquo;Yes, we know just how much of a rascal Kenyon is,
      and we know nothing at all about the other fellow, except that he wants
      the nomination, which is a bad sign. Suppose he should turn out a greater
      scamp! Really it's too much of a risk.&rdquo; he drawled, with an affectation of
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your politics always were a shock to your friends, but this serves to
      explain them,&rdquo; remarked the doctor, with latent combativeness. But Ryder
      was not to be beguiled into argument. He turned again to Miss Emory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father is not a practical politician, or he would realize that it is
      only common thrift to send Kenyon back, for I take it he has served his
      country not without profit to himself; besides, he is clamorous and
      persistent, and there seems no other way to dispose of him. It's either
      that or the penitentiary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance laughed softly. &ldquo;And so you think he can afford to be honest
      now? What shocking ethics!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my theory. Anyhow, I don't see why your father should wish me to
      forego the mild excitement of assisting to re-elect my more or less
      disreputable friend. Antioch has had very little to offer one until you
      came,&rdquo; he added, with gentle deference. Miss Emory accepted the compliment
      with the utmost composure. Once she had been rather flattered by his
      attentions, but four years make a great difference. Either he had lost in
      cleverness, or she had gained in knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a very tired young man. At one time he had possessed some
      expectations and numerous pretensions. The expectation had faded out of
      his life, but the pretence remained in the absence of any vital
      achievement. He was college-bred, and had gone in for literature. From
      literature he had drifted into journalism, and had ended in Antioch as
      proprietor of the local paper, which he contrived to edit with a lively
      irresponsibility that won him few friends, though it did gain him some
      small reputation as a humorist.
    </p>
    <p>
      His original idea had been that the management of a country weekly would
      afford him opportunity for the serious work which he believed he could do,
      but he had not done this serious work, and was not likely to do it. He
      derived a fair income from the <i>Herald</i>, and he allowed his ambitions
      to sink into abeyance, in spite of his cherished conviction that he was
      cut out for bigger things. Perhaps he had wisely decided that his
      pretensions were much safer than accomplishment, since the importance of
      what a man actually does can generally be measured, while what he might do
      admits of exaggerated claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley had known Ryder only since the occasion of the doctor's dinner, and
      felt that he could never be more than an acquired taste, if at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor took the floor, figuratively speaking, for Miss Emory's
      presence made the effort seem worth his while. He promptly relieved Oakley
      of the necessity to do more than listen, an act of charity for which the
      latter was hardly as grateful as he should have been. He was no fool, but
      there were wide realms of enlightenment where he was an absolute stranger,
      so, when Constance and Ryder came to talk of books and music, as they did
      finally, his only refuge was in silence, and he went into a sort of
      intellectual quarantine. His reading had been strictly limited to
      scientific works, and to the half-dozen trade and technical journals to
      which he subscribed, and from which he drew the larger part of his mental
      sustenance. As for music, he was familiar with the airs from the latest
      popular operas, but the masterpieces were utterly unknown, except such as
      had been brought to his notice by having sleeping-cars named in their
      honor, a practice he considered very complimentary, and possessing value
      as a strong commercial endorsement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He amused himself trying to recall whether it was the &ldquo;Tannhauser&rdquo; or the
      &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; he had ridden on the last time he was East. He was distinctly
      shocked, however, by &ldquo;Gôtterdammerung,&rdquo; which was wholly unexpected. It
      suggested such hard swearing, or Dutch Pete's untrammelled observations in
      the yards when he had caught an urchin stealing scrap-iron&mdash;a
      recognized source of revenue to the youth of Antioch. But he felt more and
      more aloof as the evening wore on. It was something of the same feeling he
      had known as a boy, after his mother's death, when, homeless and
      friendless at night, he had paused to glance in through uncurtained
      windows, with a dumb, wordless longing for the warmth and comfort he saw
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief when the doctor took him into the library to examine
      specimens of iron-ore he had picked up west of Antioch, where there were
      undeveloped mineral lands for which he was trying to secure capital. This
      was a matter Oakley was interested in, since it might mean business for
      the road. He promptly forgot about Miss Emory and the objectionable Ryder,
      and in ten minutes gave the doctor a better comprehension of the mode of
      procedure necessary to success than that gentleman had been able to learn
      in ten years of unfruitful attempting. He also supplied him with a few
      definite facts and figures in lieu of the multitude of glittering
      generalities on which he had been pinning his faith as a means of getting
      money into the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at last, they returned to the parlor, they found another caller had
      arrived during their absence, a small, shabbily dressed man, with a high,
      bald head and weak, near-sighted eyes. It was Turner Joyce. Oakley knew
      him just as he was beginning to know every other man, woman, and child in
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce rose hastily, or rather stumbled to his feet, as the doctor and
      Oakley entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I was coming up, doctor,&rdquo; he said, apologetically. &ldquo;Miss
      Constance has been very kind. She has been telling me of the galleries and
      studios. What a glorious experience!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cynical smile parted Ryder's thin lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Joyce feels the isolation of his art here.&rdquo; The little man blinked
      doubtfully at the speaker, and then said, with a gentle, deprecatory
      gesture, &ldquo;I don't call it art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are far too modest. I have heard my foreman speak in the most
      complimentary terms of the portrait you did of his wife. He was especially
      pleased with the frame. You must know. Miss Constance, that Mr. Joyce
      usually furnishes the frames, and his pictures go home ready to the wire
      to hang on the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Joyce continued to blink doubtfully at Ryder. He scarcely knew how to
      take the allusion to the frames. It was a sore point with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance turned with a displeased air from Ryder to the little artist.
      There was a faint, wistful smile on her lips. He was a rather pathetic
      figure to her, and she could not understand how Ryder dared or had the
      heart to make fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall enjoy seeing all that you have done, Mr. Joyce; and of course I
      wish to see Ruth. Why didn't she come with you to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her cousin, Lou Bentick's wife, is dead, and she has been over at his
      house all day. She was quite worn out, but she sent you her love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder glanced again at Miss Emory, and said, with hard cynicism: &ldquo;The
      notice will appear in Saturday's <i>Herald</i>, with a tribute from her
      pastor. I never refuse his verse. It invariably contains some scathing
      comment on the uncertainty of the Baptist faith as a means of salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this was wasted on Joyce. Ryder rose with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we toilers must think of the morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley accepted this as a sign that it was time to go. Joyce, too,
      stumbled across the room to the door, and the three men took their leave
      together. As they stood on the steps, the doctor said, cordially, &ldquo;I hope
      you will both come again soon; and you, too, Turner,&rdquo; he added, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryder moved off quickly with Oakley. Joyce would have dropped behind, but
      the latter made room for him at his side. No one spoke until Ryder,
      halting on a street corner, said, &ldquo;Sorry, but it's out of my way to go any
      farther unless you'll play a game of billiards with me at the hotel,
      Oakley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; curtly. &ldquo;I don't play billiards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Well, they are a waste of time, I suppose. Good-night.&rdquo; And he turned
      down the side street, whistling softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very extraordinary young man,&rdquo; murmured Joyce, rubbing the tip of his
      nose meditatively with a painty forefinger. &ldquo;And with quite an
      extraordinary opinion of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden feeling of friendliness prompted Oakley to tuck his hand through
      the little artist's arm. &ldquo;How is Bentick bearing the loss of his wife?&rdquo; he
      asked. &ldquo;You said she was your cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not mine. My wife's. Poor fellow! he feels it keenly. They had not
      been married long, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rain was falling in a steady downpour. They had reached Turner Joyce's
      gate, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you come in and wait until it moderates, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley yielded an assent, and followed him through the gate and around the
      house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE were three
      people in the kitchen, the principal living room of the Joyce home&mdash;Christopher
      Berry, the undertaker; Jeffy, the local outcast, a wretched ruin of a man;
      and Turner Joyce's wife, Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeffy was seated at a table, eating. He was a cousin of the Benticks, and
      Mrs. Joyce had furnished him with a complete outfit from her husband's
      slender wardrobe for the funeral on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley had never known him to be so well or so wonderfully dressed, and he
      had seen him in a number of surprising costumes. His black trousers barely
      reached the tops of his shoes, while the sleeves of his shiny Prince
      Albert stopped an inch or more above his wrists; he furthermore appeared
      to be in imminent danger of strangulation, such was the height and
      tightness of his collar. The thumb and forefinger of his right hand were
      gone, the result of an accident at a Fourth of July celebration, where, at
      the instigation of Mr. Gid Runyon&mdash;a gentleman possessing a lively
      turn of mind and gifted with a keen sense of humor&mdash;he had undertaken
      to hold a giant fire-cracker while it exploded, the inducement being a
      quart of whiskey, generously donated for the occasion by Mr. Runyon
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Joyce had charged herself with Jeffy's care. She was fearful that he
      might escape and sell his clothes before the funeral. She knew they would
      go immediately after, but then he would no longer be in demand as a
      mourner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jeffy, he was feeling the importance of his position. With a fine
      sense of what was expected from him as a near relative he had spent the
      day in the stricken home: its most picturesque figure, seated bolt upright
      in the parlor, a spotless cotton handkerchief in his hand, and breathing
      an air of chastened sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had exchanged mournful greetings with the friends of the family, and
      was conscious that he had acquitted himself to the admiration of all. The
      Swede &ldquo;help,&rdquo; who was new to Antioch, had thought him a person of the
      first distinction, so great was the curiosity merely to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher Berry was a little, dried-up man of fifty, whose name was
      chance, but whose profession was choice. He was his own best indorsement,
      for he was sere and yellow, and gave out a faint, dry perfume as of drugs,
      or tuberoses. &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Joyce,&rdquo; he was saying, as Oakley and the little
      artist entered the room, &ldquo;I guess there ain't nothing else to settle.
      Don't take it so to heart; there are grand possibilities in death, even if
      we can't always realize them, and we got a perfect body. I can't remember
      when I seen death so majestic, and I may say&mdash;ca'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Joyce, who was crying, dried her eyes on the corner of her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't it sad about Smith Roberts's wife! And with all those children!
      Dear, dear! It's been such a sickly spring!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The undertaker's face assumed an expression of even deeper gloom than was
      habitual to it. He coughed dryly and decorously behind his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They called in the other undertaker. I won't say I didn't feel it, Mrs.
      Joyce, for I did. I'd had the family trade, one might say, always. There
      was her father, his mother, two of her brothers, and the twins. You
      recollect the two twins, Mrs. Joyce, typhoid&mdash;in one day,&rdquo; with as
      near an approach to enthusiasm as he ever allowed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Poppleton told me over at Lou's that it was about the pleasantest
      funeral she'd ever been to, and it's durn few she's missed, I'm telling
      you!&rdquo; remarked the outcast, hoarsely. He usually slept at the gas-house in
      the winter on a convenient pile of hot cinders, and was troubled with a
      bronchial affection. &ldquo;She said she'd never seen so many flowers. Some of
      Roberts's folks sent 'em here all the ways from Chicago. Say! that didn't
      cost&mdash;oh no! I just wisht I'd the money. It'd do me for a spell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they may have had finer flowers than we got, but the floral
      offerings weren't much when the twins passed away. I remember thinking
      then that was a time for display, if one wanted display. Twins, you know&mdash;typhoid,
      too, and in one day!&rdquo; He coughed dryly again behind his hand. &ldquo;I wouldn't
      worry, Mrs. Joyce. Their body didn't compare with our body, and the body's
      the main thing, after all.&rdquo; With which professional view of the case he
      took himself out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outcast gave way to a burst of hoarse, throaty mirth. &ldquo;It just makes
      Chris Berry sick to think there's any other undertakers, but he knows his
      business; I'll say that for him any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned aggressively on Joyce. &ldquo;Did you get me them black gloves? Now,
      don't give me no fairy tales, for I know durn well from your looks you
      didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get them for you the first thing in the morning, Jeffy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeffy brandished his fork angrily in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never seen such a slip-shod way of doing things. I'd like to know what
      sort of a funeral it's going to be if I don't get them black gloves. It'll
      be a failure. Yes, sir, the durndest sort of a failure! All the Chris
      Berrys in the world can't save it. I declare I don't see why I got to have
      all this ornery worry. It ain't my funeral!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Jeffy!&rdquo; said Mrs. Joyce. &ldquo;You mustn't take on so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't he get me them gloves?&rdquo; And he glared fiercely at the meek
      figure of the little artist. Then suddenly he subsided. &ldquo;Reach me the pie,
      Ruthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Joyce turned nervously to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you going to show Mr. Oakley your pictures, Turner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you care to see them?&rdquo; with some trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will let me,&rdquo; with a grave courtesy that was instinctive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce took a lamp from the mantel. &ldquo;You will come, too, Ruth?&rdquo; he said.
      His wife was divided between her sense of responsibility and her desires.
      She nodded helplessly towards the outcast, where he grovelled noisily over
      his food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeffy will stay here until we come back, won't you, Jeffy?&rdquo; ventured
      Joyce, insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I will. There isn't anything to take me out, unless it's them black
      gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Joyce led the way into the hall. &ldquo;I am so afraid when he's out of my
      sight,&rdquo; she explained to Oakley. &ldquo;We've had such trouble in getting him
      put to rights. I couldn't go through it again. He's so trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parlor had been fitted up as a studio. There were cheap draperies on
      the walls, and numerous pictures and sketches. In one corner was a shelf
      of books, with Somebody's <i>Lives of the Painters</i> ostentatiously
      displayed. Standing on the floor, their faces turned in, were three or
      four unfinished canvases. There was also a miscellaneous litter about the
      room, composed of Indian relics and petrified wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was popularly supposed that an artist naturally took an interest in
      curios of this sort, his life being devoted to an impractical search after
      the beautiful, and the farmer who ploughed up a petrified rail, or
      discovered an Indian hand-mill, carted it in to poor Joyce, who was too
      tender-hearted to rebel; consequently he had been the recipient of several
      tons of broken rock, and would have been swamped by the accumulation, had
      not Mrs. Joyce from time to time conveyed these offerings to the back
      yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce held the lamp, so Oakley might have a better view of the pictures on
      the wall. &ldquo;Perhaps you will like to see my earlier paintings first. There!
      Is the light good? That was Mrs. Joyce just after our marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley saw a plump young lady, with her hair elaborately banged and a
      large bouquet in her hand. The background was a landscape, with a ruined
      Greek temple in the distance. &ldquo;Here she is a year later; and here she is
      again, and over there in the corner above my easel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swept the lamp back to the first picture. &ldquo;She hasn't changed much, has
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley was no critic, yet he realized that the little artist's work was
      painfully literal and exact, but then he had a sneaking idea that a good
      photograph was more satisfactory than an oil painting, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he could comprehend and appreciate, however, was Mrs. Joyce's
      attitude towards her husband's masterpieces. She was wholly and
      pathetically reverent. It was the sublime, unshaken faith and approval
      that marriage sometimes wins for a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry the light isn't any better. Mr. Oakley must come in in the
      afternoon,&rdquo; she said, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have seen some of the best examples of the modern
      painters,&rdquo; said Joyce, with a tinge of wistful envy in his tones. &ldquo;You
      know I never have. I haven't been fifty miles from Antioch in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley was ashamed to admit that the modern painters were the least of his
      cares, so he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just like Mr. Joyce. He is always doubting his ability, and every
      one says he gets wonderful likenesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said Oakley, awkwardly, inspired by a feeling of large
      humanity, &ldquo;I guess you'll have to be my guest when I go East this fall.
      You know I can always manage transportation,&rdquo; he added, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would be lovely!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Joyce, in an ecstasy of happiness
      at the mere thought. &ldquo;Could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joyce, with a rather unsteady hand, placed the lamp on the centre-table
      and gazed at his new friend with a gratitude that went beyond words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley recognized that in a small way he was committed as a patron of the
      arts, but he determined to improve upon his original offer, and send Mrs.
      Joyce with her husband. She would enter into the spirit of his pleasure as
      no one else could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't I see more of your work?&rdquo; he asked, anxious to avoid any expression
      of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd show Mr. Oakley what you are doing now, Turner. He may give
      you some valuable criticisms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For, by that unique, intuitive process of reasoning peculiar to women, she
      had decided that Oakley's judgment must be as remarkable as his
      generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His words roused Joyce, who had stood all this while with misty eyes
      blinking at Oakley. He turned and took a fresh canvas from among those
      leaning against the wall and rested it on the easel. &ldquo;This is a portrait
      I'm doing of Jared Thome's daughter. I haven't painted in the eyes yet.
      That's a point they can't agree upon. You see, there's a slight cast&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's cross-eyed, Turner,&rdquo; interjected Mrs. Joyce, positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jared wants them the way they'll be after she's been to Chicago to be
      operated on, and his wife wants them as they are now. They are to settle
      it between them before she comes for the final sitting on Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a complication,&rdquo; observed Oakley, but he did not laugh. It was
      not that he lacked a sense of humor. It was that he was more impressed by
      something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little artist blinked affectionately at his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's going to be a good likeness, quite as good as any I ever got. I
      was lucky in my flesh tints there on the cheek,&rdquo; he added, tilting his
      head critically on one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of Mr. Joyce's work?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Joyce, bent on
      committing their visitor to an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good, indeed, and perhaps he is doing a greater service in
      educating us here at Antioch than if he had made a name for himself
      abroad. Perhaps, too, he'll be remembered just as long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think so, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo; said the little artist, delighted.
      &ldquo;It may sound egotistical, but I have sometimes thought that myself&mdash;that
      these portraits of mine, bad as I know they must be, give a great deal of
      pleasure and happiness to their owners, and it's a great pleasure for me
      to do them, and we don't get much beyond that in this world, do we?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>AKLEY took the
      satchel from General Cornish's hand as the latter stepped from his private
      car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got my note, I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think I'll go to the hotel for the
      rest of the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced back over his shoulder, as he turned with Dan towards the bus
      which was waiting for them at the end of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess no one else got off here. It's not much of a railroad centre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Oakley, impartially; &ldquo;there are towns where the traffic is
      heavier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the hotel, Oakley led the way up-stairs to the general's room.
      It adjoined his own. Cornish paused on the threshold until he had lighted
      the gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light the other burner, will you?&rdquo; he requested. &ldquo;There, thanks, that's
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a portly man of sixty, with a large head and heavy face. His father
      had been a Vermont farmer, a man of position and means, according to the
      easy standard of his times. When the Civil War broke out, young Cornish,
      who was just commencing the practice of the law, had enlisted as a private
      in one of the first regiments raised by his State. Prior to this he had
      overflowed with fervid oratory, and had tried hard to look like Daniel
      Webster, but a skirmish or two opened his eyes to the fact that the waging
      of war was a sober business, and the polishing off of his sentences not
      nearly as important as the polishing off of the enemy. He was still
      willing to die for the Union, if there was need of it, but while his life
      was spared it was well to get on. The numerical importance of number one
      was a belief too firmly implanted in his nature to be overthrown by any
      patriotic aberration.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own merits, which he was among the first to recognize, and the solid
      backing his father was able to give, won him promotion. He had risen to
      the command of a regiment, and when the war ended was brevetted a
      brigadier-general of volunteers, along with a score of other anxious
      warriors who wished to carry the title of general back into civil life,
      for he was an amiable sort of a Shylock, who seldom overlooked his pound
      of flesh, and he usually got all, and a little more, than was coming to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the war he married and went West, where he resumed the practice of
      his profession, but he soon abandoned it for a commercial career. It was
      not long until he was ranked as one of the rich men of his State. Then he
      turned his attention to politics, He was twice elected to Congress, and
      served one term as governor. One of his daughters had married an Italian
      prince, a meek, prosaic little creature, exactly five feet three inches
      tall: another was engaged to an English earl, whose debts were a
      remarkable achievement for so young a man. His wife now divided her time
      between Paris and London. She didn't think much of New York, which had
      thought even less of her. He managed to see her once or twice a year. Any
      oftener would have been superfluous. But it interested him to read of her
      in the papers, and to feel a sense of proprietorship for this woman, who
      was spending his money and carrying his name into the centres of elegance
      and fashion. Personally he disliked fashion, and was rather shy of
      elegance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were moments, however, when he felt his life to be wholly
      unsatisfactory. He derived very little pleasure from all the luxury that
      had accumulated about him, and which he accepted with a curious placid
      indifference. He would have liked the affection of his children, to have
      had them at home, and there was a remote period in his past when his wife
      had inspired him with a sentiment at which he could only wonder. He held
      it against her that she had not understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lurched down solidly into the chair Oakley placed for him. &ldquo;I hope you
      are comfortable here,&rdquo; he said, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo; He still stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Cornish. &ldquo;I don't, as a rule, believe in staying up after
      midnight to talk business, but I must start East to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slipped out of his chair and began to pace the floor, with his hands
      thrust deep in his trousers-pockets. &ldquo;I want to talk over the situation
      here. I don't see that the road is ever going to make a dollar. I've an
      opportunity to sell it to the M. &amp; W. Of course this is extremely
      confidential. It must not go any further. I am told they will discontinue
      it beyond this point, and of course they will either move the shops away
      or close them.&rdquo; He paused in his rapid walk. &ldquo;It's too bad it never paid.
      It was the first thing I did when I came West. I thought it a pretty big
      thing then. I have always hoped it would justify my judgment, and it
      promised to for a while until the lumber interests played out. Now, what
      do you advise, Oakley? I want to get your ideas. You understand, if I sell
      I won't lose much. The price offered will just about meet the mortgage I
      hold, but I guess the stockholders will come out at the little end of the
      horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley understood exactly what was ahead of the stockholders if the road
      changed hands. Perhaps his face showed that he was thinking of this, for
      the general observed, charitably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's unfortunate, but you can't mix sentiment in a transaction of this
      sort. I'd like to see them all get their money back, and more, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mental attitude towards the world was one of generous liberality, but
      he had such excellent control over his impulses that, while he always
      seemed about to embark in some large philanthropy, he had never been known
      to take even the first step in that direction. In short, he was hard and
      unemotional, but with a deceptive, unswerving kindliness of manner, which,
      while it had probably never involved a dollar of his riches, had at divers
      times cost the unwary and the indiscreet much money.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man presided at the board meetings of a charity with an air of larger
      benevolence, and no man drove closer or more conscienceless bargains. His
      friends knew better than to trust him&mdash;a precaution they observed in
      common with his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure the road could be put on a paying basis,&rdquo; said Oakley. &ldquo;Certain
      quite possible economies would do that. Of course we can't create
      business, there is just so much of it, and we get it all as it is. But the
      shops might be made very profitable. I have secured a good deal of work
      for them, and I shall secure more. I had intended to propose a number of
      reforms, but if you are going to sell, why, there's no use of going into
      the matter&mdash;&rdquo; he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general meditated in silence for a moment. &ldquo;I'd hate to sacrifice my
      interests if I thought you could even make the road pay expenses. Now,
      just what do you intend to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get my order-book and show you what's been done for the shops,&rdquo; said
      Oakley, rising with alacrity. &ldquo;I have figured out the changes, too, and
      you can see at a glance just what I propose doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The road and the shops employed some five hundred men, most of whom had
      their homes in Antioch. Oakley knew that if the property was sold it would
      practically wipe the town out of existence. The situation was full of
      interest for him. If Cornish approved, and told him to go ahead with his
      reforms, it would be an opportunity such as he had never known.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into his own room, which opened off Cornish's, and got his
      order-book and table of figures, which he had carried up from the office
      that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lay on the stand with a pile of trade journals. For the first time in
      his life he viewed these latter with an unfriendly eye. He thought of
      Constance Emory, and realized that he should never again read and digest
      the annual report of the Joint Traffic Managers' Association with the same
      sense of intellectual fulness it had hitherto given him. No, clearly, that
      was a pleasure he had outgrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken a great deal of pains with his figures, and they seemed to
      satisfy Cornish that the road, if properly managed, was not such a
      hopeless proposition, after all. Something might be done with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley rose in his good esteem; he had liked him, and he was justifying
      his good opinion. He beamed benevolently on the young man, and thawed out
      of his habitual reserve into a genial, ponderous frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done well,&rdquo; he said, glancing through the order-book with
      evident satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; explained Oakley, &ldquo;I am going to make a cut in wages this
      spring, if you agree to it, but I haven't the figures for this yet.&rdquo; The
      general nodded. He approved of cuts on principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's always a wise move,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will they stand it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll have to.&rdquo; And Oakley laughed rather nervously. He appreciated
      that his reforms were likely to make him very unpopular in Antioch. &ldquo;They
      shouldn't object. If the road changes hands it will kill their town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; agreed Cornish, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And half a loaf is lots better than no loaf,&rdquo; added Oakley. Again the
      general nodded his approval. That was the very pith and Gospel of his
      financial code, and he held it as greatly to his own credit that he had
      always been perfectly willing to offer halfloaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of shape is the shop in?&rdquo; he asked, after a moment's silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good on the whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so. I spent over a hundred thousand dollars on
      the plant originally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, the equipment can hardly be called modern, but it will do for
      the sort of work for which I am bidding,&rdquo; Oakley explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it will be an interesting problem for a young man, Oakley. If you
      pull the property up it will be greatly to your credit. I was going to
      offer you another position, but we will let that go over for the present.
      I am very much pleased, though, with all you have done, very much pleased,
      indeed. I go abroad in about two weeks. My youngest daughter is to be
      married in London to the Earl of Minchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The title rolled glibly from the great man's lips. &ldquo;So you'll have the
      fight, if it is a fight, all to yourself. I'll see that Holloway does what
      you say. He's the only one you'll have to look to in my absence, but you
      won't be able to count on him for anything; he gets limp in a crisis. Just
      don't make the mistake of asking his advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather have no advice,&rdquo; interrupted Dan, hastily, &ldquo;unless it's
      yours,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see that you are not bothered. You are the sort of fellow who will
      do better with a free hand, and that is what I intend you shall have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Oakley, his heart warming with the other's praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be back in three months, and then, if your schemes have worked
      out at all as we expect, why, we can consider putting the property in
      better shape.&rdquo;&mdash;A part of Oakley's plan.&mdash;&ldquo;As you say, it's gone
      down so there won't be much but the right of way presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that eventually there'll be profits,&rdquo; said Oakley, whose mind was
      beginning to reach out into the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess the stockholders will drop dead if we ever earn a dividend.
      That's the last thing they are looking forward to,&rdquo; remarked Cornish,
      dryly. &ldquo;Will you leave a six-thirty call at the office for me? I forgot,
      and I must take the first train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley had gathered up his order-book and papers. The general was already
      fumbling with his cravat and collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very well satisfied with your plan, and I believe you have the
      ability to carry it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw aside his coat and vest and sat down to take off his shoes.
      &ldquo;Don't saddle yourself with too much work. Keep enough of an office force
      to save yourself wherever you can. I think, if orders continue to come in
      as they have been doing, the shops promise well. It just shows what a
      little energy will accomplish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With judicious nursing in the start, there should be plenty of work for
      us, and we are well equipped to handle it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Cornish. &ldquo;A lot of money was spent on the plant. I wanted it
      just right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand why more hasn't been done with the opportunity here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never been able to find the proper man to take hold, until I found
      you, Oakley. You have given me a better insight into conditions than I
      have had at any time since I built the road, and it ain't such a bad
      proposition, after all, especially the shops.&rdquo; The general turned out the
      gas as he spoke, and Oakley, as he stood in the doorway of his own room,
      saw dimly a white figure moving in the direction of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd figure close on all repair work. The thing is to get them into the
      habit of coming to us. Don't forget the call, please. Six-thirty sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slats creaked and groaned beneath his weight. &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next morning
      Oakley saw General Cornish off on the 7.15 train, and then went back to
      his hotel for breakfast Afterwards, on his way to the office he mailed a
      check to Ezra Hart for his father. The money was intended to meet his
      expenses in coming West.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very busy all that day making out his new schedules, and in
      figuring the cuts and just what they would amount to. He approached his
      task with a certain reluctance, for it was as unpleasant to him personally
      as it was necessary to the future of the road, and he knew that no
      half-way measures would suffice. He must cut, as a surgeon cuts, to save.
      By lopping away a man here and there, giving his work to some other man,
      or dividing it up among two or three men, he managed to peel off two
      thousand dollars on the year. He counted that a very fair day's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would start his reform with no particular aggressiveness. He would
      retire the men he intended to dismiss from the road one at a time. He
      hoped they would take the hint and hunt other positions. At any rate, they
      could not get back until he was ready to take them back, as Cornish had
      assured him he would not be interfered with. He concluded not to hand the
      notices and orders to Miss Walton, the typewriter, to copy. She might let
      drop some word that would give his victims an inkling of what was in store
      for them. He knew there were unpleasant scenes ahead of him, but there was
      no need to anticipate. When at last his figures for the cuts were complete
      he would have been grateful for some one with whom to discuss the
      situation. All at once his responsibilities seemed rather heavier than he
      had bargained for.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only two men in the office besides himself&mdash;Philip Kerr,
      the treasurer, and Byron Holt, his assistant. They were both busy with the
      payroll, as it was the sixth of the month, and they commenced to pay off
      in the shops on the tenth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had little or no use for Kerr, who still showed, where he dared, in
      small things his displeasure that an outsider had been appointed manager
      of the road. He had counted on the place for himself for a number of
      years, but a succession of managers had come and gone apparently without
      its ever having occurred to General Cornish that an excellent executive
      was literally spoiling in the big, bare, general offices of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      This singular indifference on the part of Cornish to his real interests
      had soured a disposition that at its best had more of acid in it than
      anything else. As there was no way in which he could make his resentment
      known to the general, even if he had deemed such a course expedient, he
      took it out of Oakley, and kept his feeling for him on ice. Meanwhile he
      hided his time, hoping for Oakley's downfall and his own eventual
      recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the assistant treasurer, Dan's relations were entirely cordial. Holt
      was a much younger man than Kerr, as frank and open as the other was
      secret and reserved. When the six-o'clock whistle blew he glanced up from
      his work and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd wait a moment, Holt. I want to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kerr had already gone home, and Miss Walton was adjusting her hat before a
      bit of a mirror that hung on the wall back of her desk. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo;
       responded Holt, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just draw up your chair,&rdquo; said Oakley, handing his papers to him. At
      first Holt did not understand; then he began to whistle softly, and fell
      to checking off the various cuts with his forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of the job, Byron?&rdquo; inquired Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad I don't get laid off, that's sure. Say, just bear in mind
      that I'm going to be married this summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't worry; only I didn't know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, please don't forget it, Mr. Oakley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holt ran over the cuts again. Then he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's going to stand for this? You or the old man? I hear he was in town
      last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stand for it, but of course he approves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet he approves,&rdquo; and the assistant treasurer grinned. &ldquo;This is the
      sort of thing that suits him right down to the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the hands? Do you know if they are members of any union?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but there'll be lively times ahead for you. They are a great lot of
      kickers here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until I get through. I haven't touched the shops yet; that's to come
      later. I'll skin closer before I'm done.&rdquo; Oakley got up and lit his pipe.
      &ldquo;The plant must make some sort of a showing. We can't continue at the rate
      we have been going. I suppose you know what sort of shape it would leave
      the town in if the shops were closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn poor shape, I should say. Why, it's the money that goes in and out
      of this office twice a month that keeps the town alive. It couldn't exist
      a day without that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it behooves us to see to it that nothing happens to the shops or
      road. I am sorry for the men I am laying off, but it can't be helped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are going to chuck Hoadley out of his good thing at the
      Junction. If he was half white he'd a gone long ago. He must lay awake
      nights figuring how he can keep decently busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the list all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. No, it's not, either. You've marked off Joe Percell at Harrison. He
      used to brake for the Huckleberry until he lost an arm. His is a pension
      job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put his name back, then. How do you think it's going to work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it will work all right, because it has to, but they'll all be cussing
      you,&rdquo; with great good humor. &ldquo;What's the matter, anyhow? Did the old man
      throw a fit at the size of the pay-roll?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly, but he came down here with his mind made up to sell the road
      to the M. &amp; W.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talked him out of that, but we must make a showing, for he's good and
      tired, and may dump the whole business any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he does that there'll be no marrying or giving in marriage for
      me this summer. It will be just like a Shaker settlement where I am
      concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan laughed. &ldquo;Oh, you'd be all right, Holt. You'd get something else, or
      the M. &amp; W. would keep you on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that. A new management generally means a clean sweep
      all round, and my berth's a pretty good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In some manner a rumor of the changes Oakley proposed making did get
      abroad, and he was promptly made aware that his popularity in Antioch was
      a thing of the past. He was regarded as an oppressor from whom some
      elaborate and wanton tyranny might be expected. While General Cornish
      suffered their inefficiency, his easy-going predecessors had been content
      to draw their salaries and let it go at that, a line of conduct which
      Antioch held to be entirely proper. This new man, however, was clearly an
      upstart, cursed with an insane and destructive ambition to earn money from
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose it did not pay. Cornish could go down into his pocket for the
      difference, just as he had always done.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the town did not know, and what it would not have believed even if it
      had been told, was that the general had been on the point of selling&mdash;a
      change that would have brought hardship to every one. The majority of the
      men in the shops owned their own homes, and these homes represented the
      savings of years. The sudden exodus of two or three hundred families meant
      of necessity widespread ruin. Those who were forced to go away would have
      to sacrifice everything they possessed to get away, while those who
      remained would be scarcely better off. But Antioch never considered such a
      radical move as even remotely possible. It counted the shops a fixture;
      they had always been there, and for this sufficient reason they would
      always remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days wore on, one very like another, with their spring heat and
      lethargy. Occasionally, Oakley saw Miss Emory on the street to bow to, but
      not to speak with; while he was grateful for these escapes, he found
      himself thinking of her very often. He fancied&mdash;and he was not far
      wrong&mdash;that she was finding Antioch very dull. He wondered, too, if
      she was seeing much of Ryder. He imagined that she was; and here again he
      was not far wrong. Now and then he was seized with what he felt to be a
      weak desire to call, but he always thought better of it in time, and was
      always grateful he had not succumbed to the impulse. But her mere presence
      in Antioch seemed to make him dissatisfied and resentful of its
      limitations. Ordinarily he was not critical of his surroundings. Until she
      came, that he was without companionship and that the town was given over
      to a deadly inertia which expressed itself in the collapsed ambition of
      nearly every man and woman he knew, had scarcely affected him beyond
      giving him a sense of mild wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard nothing of his father, and in the pressure of his work and
      freshened interest in the fortunes of the Huckleberry, had hardly given
      him a second thought. He felt that, since he had sent money to him, he was
      in a measure relieved of all further responsibility. If his father did not
      wish to come to him, that was his own affair. He had placed no obstacle in
      his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had gone through life without any demand having been made on his
      affections. On those rare occasions that he devoted to self-analysis he
      seriously questioned if he possessed any large capacity in that direction.
      The one touch of sentiment to which he was alive was the feeling he
      centred about the few square feet of turf where his mother lay under the
      sweet-briar and the old elms in the burying-plot of the little Eastern
      village. The sexton was instructed to see that the spot was not neglected,
      and that there were always flowers on the grave. She had loved flowers. It
      was somehow a satisfaction to Dan to overpay him for this care. But he had
      his moments of remorse, because he was unable to go back there. Once or
      twice he had started East, fully intending to do so, but had weakened at
      the last moment. Perhaps he recognized that while it was possible to
      return to a place, it was not possible to return to an emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley fell into the habit of working at the office after the others left
      in the evening. He liked the quiet of the great bare room and the solitude
      of the silent, empty shops. Sometimes Holt remained, too, and discussed
      his matrimonial intentions, or entertained his superior with an account of
      his previous love affairs, for the experiences were far beyond his years.
      He had exhausted the possibilities of Antioch quite early in life. At one
      time or another he had either been engaged, or almost engaged, to every
      pretty girl in the place. He explained his seeming inconsistency, however,
      by saying he was naturally of a very affectionate disposition.

      as Oakley sat at his desk in the broad streak of yellow light that the sun
      sent in through the west windows, he heard a step on the narrow board-walk
      that ran between the building and the tracks. The last shrill shriek of
      No. 7, as usual, half an hour late, had just died out in the distance, and
      the informal committee of town loafers which met each train was plodding
      up Main Street to the post-office in solemn silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced around as the door into the yards opened, expecting to see
      either Holt or Kerr. Instead he saw a tall, gaunt man of sixty-five, a
      little stoop-shouldered, and carrying his weight heavily and solidly. His
      large head was sunk between broad shoulders. It was covered by a wonderful
      growth of iron-gray hair. The face was clean-shaven and had the look of a
      placid mask. There was a curious repose in the man's attitude as he stood
      with a big hand&mdash;the hand of an artisan&mdash;resting loosely on the
      knob of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you. Dannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile that accompanied the words was at once anxious, hesitating, and
      inquiring. He closed the door with awkward care and coming a step nearer,
      put out his hand. Oakley, breathing hard, rose hastily from his chair, and
      stood leaning against the corner of his desk as if he needed its support.
      He was white to the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause while the two men looked into each other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know me, Dannie?&rdquo; wistfully. Dan said nothing, but he extended
      his hand, and his father's fingers closed about it with a mighty pressure.
      Then, quite abruptly, Roger Oakley turned and walked over to the window.
      Once more there was absolute silence in the room, save for the ticking of
      the clock and the buzzing of a solitary fly high up on the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old convict was the first to break the tense stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had about made up my mind I should never see you again, Dannie. When
      your mother died and you came West it sort of wiped out the little there
      was between me and the living. In fact, I really didn't know you would
      care to see me, and when Hart told me you wished me to come to you and had
      sent the money, I could hardly believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the words failed him utterly. He turned slowly and looked into his
      son's face long and lovingly. &ldquo;I've thought of you as a little boy for all
      these years, Dannie&mdash;as no higher than that,&rdquo; dropping his hand to
      his hip. &ldquo;And here you are a man grown. But you got your mother's look&mdash;I'd
      have known you by it among a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Dan had felt any fear of his father it had left him the instant he
      entered the room. Whatever he might have done, whatever he might have
      been, there was no question as to the manner of man he had become. He
      stepped to his son's side and took his hand in one of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've made a man of yourself. I can see that. What do you do here for a
      living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan laughed, queerly. &ldquo;I am the general manager of the railroad, father,&rdquo;
       nodding towards the station and the yards. &ldquo;But it's not much to brag
      about. It's only a one-horse line,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don't mean it, Dannie!&rdquo; And he could see that his father was
      profoundly impressed. He put up his free hand and gently patted Dan's head
      as though he were indeed the little boy he remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have an easy trip West, father?&rdquo; Oakley asked. &ldquo;You must be
      tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit, Dannie. It was wonderful. I'd been shut off from it all for
      more than twenty years, and each mile was taking me nearer you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warm yellow light was beginning to fade from the room. It was growing
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we'd better go up-town to the hotel and have our supper. Where is
      your trunk? At the station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got nothing but a bundle. It's at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan locked his desk, and they left the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it all yours?&rdquo; Roger Oakley asked, pausing as they crossed the yards,
      to glance up and down the curving tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's part of the property I manage. It belongs to General Cornish, who
      holds most of the stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the train I came on, Dannie, who owned that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Buckhorn Junction, where you changed cars for the last time, you
      caught our local express. It runs through to a place called Harrison&mdash;the
      terminus of the line. This is only a branch road, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the explanation was lost on his father. His son's relation to the road
      was a magnificent fact which he pondered with simple pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      After their supper at the hotel they went up-stairs. Roger Oakley had been
      given a room next his son's. It was the same room General Cornish had
      occupied when he was in Antioch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to put away your things now?&rdquo; asked Dan, as he placed his
      father's bundle, which he had carried up-town from the office, on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do that by and by. There ain't much there&mdash;just a few little
      things I've managed to keep, or that have been given me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan pushed two chairs before an open window that overlooked the square.
      His father had taken a huge blackened meerschaum from its case and was
      carefully filling it from a leather pouch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mind if I light my pipe?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. I've one in my pocket, but it's not nearly as fine as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our warden gave it to me one Christmas, and I've smoked it ever since. He
      was a very good man, Dannie. It's the old warden I'm speaking of, not
      Kenyon, the new one, though he's a good man, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan wondered where he had heard the name of Kenyon before; then he
      remembered&mdash;it was at the Emorys'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try some of my tobacco, Dannie,&rdquo; passing the pouch.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the two men sat in silence, blowing clouds of white smoke out
      into the night. Under the trees, just bursting into leaf, the street-lamps
      flickered in a long, dim perspective, and now and then a stray word
      floated up to them, coming from a group of idlers on the corner below the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley hitched his chair nearer his son's, and rested a heavy hand
      on his knee. &ldquo;I like it here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you? I am glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will be the chances of my finding work? You know I'm a cabinet-maker
      by trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no need of your working; so don't worry about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must work, Dannie. I ain't used to sitting still and doing
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Oakley, willing to humor him, &ldquo;there are the car shops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you get me in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, when you are ready to start. I'll have McClintock, the master
      mechanic, find something in your line for you to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll need to get a kit of tools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess McClintock can arrange that, too. I'll see him about it when you
      are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that's settled. I'll begin in the morning,&rdquo; with quiet
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you want to look around first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have my Sundays for that.&rdquo; And Dan saw that there was no use in
      arguing the point with him. He was bent on having his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old convict filled his lungs with a deep, free breath. &ldquo;Yes, I'm going
      to like it. I always did like a small town, anyhow. Tell me about
      yourself, Dannie. How do you happen to be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan roused himself. &ldquo;I don't know. It's chance, I suppose. After mother's
      death&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty years ago last March,&rdquo; breaking in upon him, softly; then, nodding
      at the starlit heavens, &ldquo;She's up yonder now, watching us. Nothing's
      hidden or secret. It's all plain to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think that, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Dannie.&rdquo; And his tone was one of settled conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan had already discovered that his father was deeply religious. It was a
      faith the like of which had not descended to his own day and generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I had it rather hard for a while,&rdquo; going back to his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with keen sympathy. &ldquo;You were nothing but a little boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, I was lucky enough to get a place as a newsboy on a train. I
      sold papers until I was sixteen, and then began braking. I wanted to be an
      engineer, but I guess my ability lay in another direction. At any rate,
      they took me off the road and gave me an office position instead. I got to
      be a division superintendent, and then I met General Cornish. He is one of
      the directors of the line I was with at the time. Three months ago he made
      me an offer to take hold here, and so here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you've never been back home, Dannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never once. I've wanted to go, but I couldn't.&rdquo; He hoped his father would
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there ain't much to take you there but her grave. I wish she might
      have lived, you'd have been a great happiness to her, and she got very
      little happiness for her portion any ways you look at it. We were only
      just married when the war came, and I was gone four years. Then there was
      about eleven years When we were getting on nicely. We had money put by,
      and owned our own home. Can you remember it, Dannie? The old brick place
      on the corner across from the post-office. A new Methodist church stands
      there now. It was sold to get money for my lawyer when the big trouble
      came. Afterwards, when everything was spent, she must have found it very
      hard to make a living for herself and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did,&rdquo; said Dan, gently. &ldquo;But she managed somehow to keep a roof over
      our heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the law sets out to punish it don't stop with the guilty only. When
      I went to her grave and saw there were flowers growing on it, and that it
      was being cared for, it told me what you were. She was a very brave woman,
      Dannie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; pityingly, &ldquo;she was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Few women have had the sorrow she had, and few women could have borne up
      under it as she did. You know that was an awful thing about Sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put up his hand and wiped the great drops of perspiration from his
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan turned towards him quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you speak of it? It's all past now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd sort of like to tell you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, and he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sharp and I had been enemies for a long time. It started back before the
      war, when he wanted to marry your mother. We both enlisted in the same
      regiment, and somehow the trouble kept alive. He was a bit of a bully, and
      I was counted a handy man with my fists, too. The regiment was always
      trying to get us into the ring together, but we knew it was dangerous. We
      had sense enough for that. I won't say he would have done it, but I never
      felt safe when there was a fight on in all those four years. It's easy
      enough to shoot the man in front of you and no one be the wiser. Many a
      score's been settled that way. When we got home again we didn't get along
      any better. He was a drinking man, and had no control over himself when
      liquor got the best of him. I did my share in keeping the feud alive. What
      he said of me and what I said of him generally reached both of us in time,
      as you can fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, when I joined the church, I concluded it wasn't right to hate a
      man the way I hated Sharp, for, you see, he'd never really done anything
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day I stopped in at the smithy&mdash;he was a blacksmith&mdash;to
      have a talk with him and see if we couldn't patch it up somehow and be
      friends. It was a Saturday afternoon, and he'd been drinking more than was
      good for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn't hardly got the first words out when he came at me with a big
      sledge in his hand, all in a rage, and swearing he'd have my life. I
      pushed him off and started for the door. I saw it was no use to try to
      reason with him, but he came at me again, and this time he struck me with
      his sledge. It did no harm, though it hurt, and I pushed him out of my way
      and backed off towards the door. The lock was caught, and before I could
      open it, he was within striking distance again, and I had to turn to
      defend myself. I snatched up a bar of iron perhaps a foot long. I had kept
      my temper down until then, but the moment I had a weapon in my hand it got
      clean away from me, and in an instant I was fighting&mdash;just as he was
      fighting&mdash;to kill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley had told the story of the murder in a hard, emotionless
      voice, but Dan saw in the half-light that his face was pale and drawn. Dan
      found it difficult to associate the thought of violence with the man at
      his side, whose whole manner spoke of an unusual restraint and control.
      That he had killed a man, even in self-defence, seemed preposterous and
      inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a part of the story Roger Oakley could not tell, and which his
      son had no desire to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People said afterwards that I'd gone there purposely to pick a quarrel
      with Sharp, and his helper, who, it seems, was in the yard back of the
      smithy setting a wagon tire, swore he saw me through a window as I
      entered, and that I struck the first blow. He may have seen only the end
      of it, and really believed I did begin it, but that's a sample of how
      things got twisted. Nobody believed my motive was what I said it was. The
      jury found me guilty of murder, and the judge gave me a life sentence. A
      good deal of a fuss was made over what I did at the fire last winter. Hart
      told me he'd sent you the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan nodded, and his father continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some ladies who were interested in mission work at the prison took the
      matter up and got me my pardon. It's a fearful and a wicked thing for a
      man to lose his temper, Dannie. At first I was bitter against every one
      who had a hand in sending me to prison, but I've put that all from my
      heart. It was right I should be punished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his chair, striking the ashes from his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't it very late, Dannie? I'll just put away my things, and then we can
      go to bed. I didn't mean to keep you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley watched his precise and orderly arrangement of his few belongings.
      He could see that it was a part of the prison discipline under which he
      had lived for almost a quarter of a century. When the contents of his
      bundle were disposed of to his satisfaction, he put on a pair of
      steel-rimmed spectacles, with large, round glasses, and took up a
      well-thumbed Bible, which he had placed at one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you haven't forgotten this book, Dannie,&rdquo; tapping it softly with a
      heavy forefinger.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">K</span>ERR and Holt were
      at Buckhom Junction with the pay-car, a decrepit caboose that complained
      in every wheel as the engine jerked it over the rails. Holt said that its
      motion was good for Kerr's dyspepsia. He called it the pay-car cure, and
      professed to believe it a subtle manifestation of the general's
      benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Walton was having a holiday. This left Oakley the sole tenant of the
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had returned from Chicago the day before, where he had gone to drum up
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot, breathless morning in May. The machinery in the shops droned
      on and on, with the lazy, softened hum of revolving wheels, or the swish
      of swiftly passing belts. A freight was cutting out cars in the yards. It
      was rather noisy and bumped discordantly in and out of the sidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the tracks and a narrow field, where the young corn stood in fresh
      green rows, was a line of stately sycamores and vivid willows that
      bordered Billup's Fork. Tradition had it that an early settler by the name
      of Billup had been drowned there&mdash;a feat that must have required
      considerable ingenuity on his part, as the stream was nothing but a series
      of shallow riffles, with an occasional deep hole. Once Jeffy, generously
      drunk, had attempted to end his life in the fork. He had waded in above
      his shoe-tops, only to decide that the water was too cold, and had waded
      out again, to the keen disappointment of six small boys on the bank, who
      would have been grateful for any little excitement. He said he wanted to
      live to invent a drink that tasted as good coming up as it did going down;
      there was all kinds of money in such a drink. But the boys felt they had
      been swindled, and threw stones at him. It is sometimes difficult to
      satisfy an audience. Nearer at hand, but invisible, Clarence was
      practising an elusive dance-step in an empty coal-car. He was inspired by
      a lofty ambition to equal&mdash;he dared not hope to excel&mdash;a
      gentleman he had seen at a recent minstrel performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      McClintock, passing, had inquired sarcastically if it was his busy day,
      but Clarence had ignored the question. He felt that he had nothing in
      common with one who possessed such a slavish respect for mere industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently McClintock wandered in from the hot out-of-doors to talk over
      certain repairs he wished undertaken in the shops. He was a typical
      American mechanic, and Oakley liked him, as he always liked the man who
      knew his business and earned his pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discussed the repairs, and then Oakley asked, &ldquo;How's my father
      getting along, Milt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right. He's a little slow, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he on now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those blue-line cars that came in last month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't much in that batch. I had to figure close to get the work.
      Keep the men moving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are about done. I'll put the painters on the job to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McClintock went over to the water-cooler in the corner and filled a
      stemless tumbler with ice-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be ready to send them up to Buckhorn the last of next week. Is
      there anything else in sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gulped down the water at a single swallow. &ldquo;No, not at present, but
      there are one or two pretty fair orders coming in next month that I was
      lucky enough to pick up in Chicago. Isn't there any work of our own we can
      go at while things are slack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots of it,&rdquo; wiping his hands on the legs of his greasy overalls. &ldquo;All
      our day coaches need paint, and some want new upholstery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd better go at that, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll take a look at the cars in the yards, and see what I can
      put out in place of those we call in. There's no use talking, Mr. Oakley,
      you've done big things for the shops,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am getting some work for them, and while there isn't much profit
      in it, perhaps, it's a great deal better than being idle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a whole lot,&rdquo; agreed McClintock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can pick up contracts enough to keep us busy through the
      summer. I understand you've always had to shut down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or half-time,&rdquo; disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we can worry through without that; at any rate, I want to,&rdquo;
       observed Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go see how I can manage about our own repairs,&rdquo; said McClintock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out, and from the window Oakley saw him with a bunch of keys in
      his hand going in the direction of a line of battered day coaches on one
      of the sidings. The door opened again almost immediately to admit Griff
      Ryder. This was almost the last person in Antioch from whom Dan was
      expecting a call. The editor's cordiality as he greeted him made him
      instantly suspect that some favor was wanted. Most people who came to the
      office wanted favors. Usually it was either a pass or a concession on
      freight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, Kerr met all such applicants. His manner fitted him for just
      such interviews, and he had no gift for popularity, which suffered in
      consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryder pushed a chair over beside Oakley's and seated himself. By sliding
      well down on his spine he managed to reach the low sill of the window with
      his feet. He seemed to admire the effect, for he studied them in silence
      for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a little matter I want to speak to you about, Oakley. I've been
      intending to run in for the past week, but I have been so busy I
      couldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley nodded for him to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, I'd like to feel that you were for Kenyon. You can be
      of a great deal of use to us this election. It's going to be close, and
      Kenyon's a pretty decent sort of a chap to have come out of these parts.
      You ought to take an interest in seeing him re-elected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley surmised that this was the merest flattery intended to tickle his
      vanity. He answered promptly that he didn't feel the slightest interest in
      politics one way or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but one good fellow ought to wish to see another good fellow get
      what he's after, and you can help us if you've a mind to; but this isn't
      what I've come for. It's about Hoadley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Hoadley?&rdquo; quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got the idea that his days with the Huckleberry are about numbered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you haven't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is he kicking about? When he's to go, he'll hear of it from
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, just the same, it's in the air that there's to be a shake-up, and
      that a number of men, and Hoad-ly among them, are going to be laid off.
      Now, he's another good fellow, and he's a friend of mine, and I told him
      I'd come in and fix it up with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you can fix it up with me, Mr. Ryder. Just the same, I'd
      like to know how this got out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is to be a shake-up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley bit his lips. &ldquo;You seem to take it for granted there is to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there's something back of the rumor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as well tell you why Hoadley's got to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is to go, then? I thought my information was correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, he's not needed, and in the second place, he's a lazy
      loafer. The road must earn its keep. General Cornish is sick of putting
      his hand in his pocket every six months to keep it out of bankruptcy. You
      are enough of a business man to know he won't stand that sort of thing
      forever. Of course I am sorry for Hoadley if he needs the money, but some
      one's got to suffer, and he happens to be the one. I'll take on his work
      myself. I can do it, and that's a salary saved. I haven't any personal
      feeling in the matter. The fact that I don't like him, as it happens, has
      nothing to do with it. If he were my own brother he'd have to get out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see that one man, more or less, is going to make such a hell of a
      difference, Oakley,&rdquo; Ryder urged, with what he intended should be an air
      of frank good-fellowship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you?&rdquo; with chilly dignity. Oakley was slow to anger, but he had
      always fought stubbornly for what he felt was due him, and he wished the
      editor to understand that the management of the B. &amp; A. was distinctly
      not his province.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryder's eyes were half closed, and only a narrow slit of color showed
      between the lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much afraid we won't hit it off. I begin to see we aren't going
      to get on. I want you to keep Hoadley as a personal favor to me. Just wait
      until I finish. If you are going in for reform, I may have it in my power
      to be of some service to you. You will need some backing here, and even a
      country newspaper can manufacture public sentiment. Now if we aren't to be
      friends you will find me on the other side, and working just as hard
      against you as I am willing to work for you if you let Hoadley stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't allow anybody to talk like that to me. I am running this for
      Cornish. They are his interests, not mine, and you can start in and
      manufacture all the public sentiment you damn please.&rdquo; Then he cooled down
      a bit and felt ashamed of himself for the outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to be unfair to any one if I can help it. But if the
      road's earnings don't meet the operating expenses the general will sell it
      to the M. &amp; W. Do you understand what that means? It will knock
      Antioch higher than a kite, for the shops will be closed. I guess when all
      hands get that through their heads they will take it easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just the point I made. Who is going to enlighten them if it isn't
      me? I don't suppose you will care to go around telling everybody what a
      fine fellow you are, and how thankful they should be that you have stopped
      their wages. We can work double, Oakley. I want Hoadley kept because he's
      promised me his influence for Kenyon if I'd exert myself in his behalf.
      He's of importance up at the Junction. Of course we know he's a drunken
      beast, but that's got nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, but he's got to go,&rdquo; said Oakley, doggedly. &ldquo;A one-horse
      railroad can't carry dead timber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; And Ryder pulled in his legs and rose slowly from his chair.
      &ldquo;If you can't and won't see it as I do it's your lookout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley laughed, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I'll be able to meet the situation, Mr. Ryder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will, and perhaps you won't. We'll see about that when the
      time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard what I said about the M. &amp; W.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand what it means&mdash;the closing of the shops?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess that's a long ways off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stalked over to the door with his head in the air. He was mad clear
      through. At the door he turned. Hoadley's retention meant more to him than
      he would have admitted. It was not that he cared a rap for Hoadley. On the
      contrary, he detested him, but the fellow was a power in country politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you should think better of it&mdash;&rdquo; and he was conscious his manner
      was weak with the weakness of the man who has asked and failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha'n't,&rdquo; retorted Oakley, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scouted the idea that Ryder, with his little country newspaper could
      either help or harm him.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>OGER OAKLEY had
      gone to work in the car-shops the day following his arrival in Antioch.
      Dan had sought to dissuade him, but he was stubbornness itself, and the
      latter realized that the only thing to do was to let him alone, and not
      seek to control him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, if he would be happier at work, it was no one's affair but his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      It never occurred to the old convict that pride might have to do with the
      stand Dan took in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wonderfully gentle and affectionate, with a quaint, unworldly
      simplicity that was rather pathetic. His one anxiety was to please Dan,
      but, in spite of this anxiety, once a conviction took possession of him he
      clung to it with unshaken tenacity in the face of every argument his son
      could bring to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the inspiration of his newly acquired freedom, he developed in
      unexpected ways. As soon as he felt that his place in the shops was secure
      and that he was not to be interfered with, he joined the Methodist Church.
      Its services occupied most of his spare time. Every Thursday night found
      him at prayer-meeting. Twice each Sunday he went to church, and by missing
      his dinner he managed to take part in the Sunday-school exercises. A
      social threw him into a flutter of pleased expectancy. Not content with
      what his church offered, irrespective of creed, he joined every society in
      the place of a religious or temperance nature, and was a zealous and
      active worker among such of the heathen as flourished in Antioch. There
      was a stern Old Testament flavor to his faith. He would have dragged the
      erring from their peril by main strength, and have regulated their morals
      by legal enactments. Those of the men with whom he came in contact in the
      shops treated him with the utmost respect, partly on his own account, and
      partly because of Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      McClintock always addressed him as &ldquo;The Deacon,&rdquo; and soon ceased to
      overflow with cheerful profanity in his presence. The old man had early
      taken occasion to point out to him the error of his ways and to hint at
      what was probably in store for him unless he curbed the utterances of his
      tongue. He was not the only professing Christian in the car-shops, but he
      was the only one who had ventured to &ldquo;call down&rdquo; the master-mechanic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half of all he earned he gave to the church. The remainder of his slender
      income he divided again into two equal parts. One of these he used for his
      personal needs, the other disappeared mysteriously. He was putting it by
      for &ldquo;Dannie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a disappointment to him that his son took only the most casual
      interest in religious matters. He comforted himself, however, with the
      remembrance that at his age his own interest had been merely traditional.
      It was only after his great trouble that the awakening came. He was quite
      certain &ldquo;Dannie&rdquo; would experience this awakening, too, some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he undertook the regeneration of Jeffy. Every new-comer in Antioch
      of a philanthropic turn of mind was sure sooner or later to fall foul of
      the outcast, who was usually willing to drop whatever he was doing to be
      reformed. It pleased him and interested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was firmly grounded in the belief, however, that in his case the
      reformation that would really reform would have to be applied externally,
      and without inconvenience to himself, but until the spiritual genius
      turned up who could work this miracle, he was perfectly willing to be
      experimented upon by any one who had a taste for what he called good
      works.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Mrs. Bentick's funeral he had found the means, derived in part from
      the sale of Turner Joyce's wardrobe, to go on a highly sensational drunk,
      which comprehended what was known in Antioch as &ldquo;The Snakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley had unearthed him at the gas-house, a melancholy, tattered
      ruin. He had rented a room for his occupancy, and had conveyed him thither
      under cover of the night. During the week that followed, while Jeffy was
      convalescent, he spent his evenings there reading to him from the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeffy would have been glad to escape these attentions. This new moral
      force in the community inspired an emotion akin to awe. Day by day, as he
      recognized the full weight of authority in Roger Oakley's manner towards
      him, this awe increased, until at last it developed into an acute fear. So
      he kept his bed and meditated flight. He even considered going as far away
      as Buckhom or Harrison to be rid of the old man. Then, by degrees, he felt
      himself weaken and succumb to the other's control. His cherished freedom&mdash;the
      freedom of the woods and fields, and the drunken spree variously attained,
      seemed only a happy memory. But the last straw was put upon him, and he
      rebelled when his benefactor announced that he was going to find work for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Jeffy had preferred not to take this seriously. He assumed to
      regard it as a delicate sarcasm on the part of his new friend. He closed
      first one watery eye and then the other. It was such a good joke. But
      Roger Oakley only reiterated his intention with unmistakable seriousness.
      It was no joke, and the outcast promptly sat up in bed, while a look of
      slow horror overspread his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I ain't never worked, Mr. Oakley,&rdquo; he whined, hoarsely. &ldquo;I don't feel
      no call to work. The fact is, I am too busy to work. I would be wasting my
      time if I done that. I'd be durn thankful if you could reform me, but I'll
      tell you right now this ain't no way to begin. No, sir, you couldn't make
      a worse start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's high time you went at something,&rdquo; said his self-appointed guide and
      monitor, with stony conviction, and he backed his opinion with a quotation
      from the Scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to Jeffy, who had been prayerfully brought up by a pious mother, the
      Scriptures were the fountain-head of all earthly wisdom. To invoke a
      citation from the Bible was on a par with calling in the town marshal. It
      closed the incident so far as argument was concerned. He was vaguely aware
      that there was one text which he had heard which seemed to give him
      authority to loaf, but he couldn't remember it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley looked at him rather sternly over the tops of his
      steel-rimmed spectacles, and said, with quiet determination, &ldquo;I am going
      to make a man of you. You've got it in you. There's hope in every human
      life. You must let drink alone, and you must work. Work's what you need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it ain't. I never done a day's work in my life. It'd kill me if I had
      to get out and hustle and sweat and bile in the sun. Durnation! of all
      fool ideas! I never seen the beat!&rdquo; He threw himself back on the bed,
      stiff and rigid, and covered his face with the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      For perhaps a minute he lay perfectly still. Then the covers were seen to
      heave tumultuously, while short gasps and sobs were distinctly audible.
      Presently two skinny but expressive legs habited in red flannel were
      thrust from under the covers and kicked violently back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A firm hand plucked the sheet from before the outcast's face, and the
      gaunt form of the old convict bent grimly above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Jeffy, I didn't expect this of you. I am willing to help you
      in every way I can. I'll get my son to make a place for you at the shops.
      How will you like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'll I like it? You ought to know me well enough to know I won't like
      it a little bit!&rdquo; in tearful and indignant protest. &ldquo;You just reach me
      them pants of mine off the back of that chair. You mean well, I'll say
      that much for you, but you got the sweatiest sort of a religion; durned if
      it ain't all work! Just reach me them pants, do now,&rdquo; and he half rose up
      in his bed, only to encounter a strong arm that pushed him back on the
      pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't have your pants, Jeffy, not now. You must stay here until you
      get well and strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I going to get well and strong with you hounding me to death? I
      never seen such a man to take up with an idea and stick to it against all
      reason. It just seems as if you'd set to work to break my spirit,&rdquo;
       plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley frowned at him in silence for a moment, then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we'd talked all this over, Jeffy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just wanted to encourage you. I was mighty thankful to have you take
      hold. I hadn't been reformed for over a year. It about seemed to me that
      everybody had forgotten I needed to be reformed, and I was willing to give
      you a chance. No one can't ever say I ain't stood ready to do that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my poor Jeffy, you will have to do more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blamed if it don't seem to me as if you was expecting me to do it all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old convict drew up a chair to the bedside and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you told me you wanted to be a man and to be respected?&rdquo; said
      this philanthropist, with evident displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeffy choked down a sob and sat up again. He gestured freely with his arms
      in expostulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was drunk when I said that. Yes, sir, I was as full as I could stick.
      Now I'm sober, I know rotten well what I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, Jeffy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want a lot of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, it ain't no prayers, and it ain't no Bible talks, and it ain't
      no lousy work. It's coming warm weather. I want to lay up along the
      crick-bank in the sun and do nothing&mdash;what I always done. I've had a
      durned hard winter, and I been a-living for the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of the keenest disappointment clouded Roger Oakley's face as Jeffy
      voiced his ignoble ambitions. His resentment gave way to sorrow. He
      murmured a prayer that he might be granted strength and patience for his
      task, and as he prayed with half-closed eyes, the outcast plugged his ears
      with his fingers. He was a firm believer in the efficacy of prayer, and he
      felt he couldn't afford to take any chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley turned to him with greater gentleness of manner than he had
      yet shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you want the love and confidence of your neighbors, Jeffy?&rdquo; he
      asked, pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't got no neighbors, except the bums who sleep along of me at the
      gas-house winter nights. I always feel this way when I come off a spree;
      first it seems as if I'd be willing never to touch another drop of licker
      as long as I lived. I just lose interest in everything, and I don't care a
      durn what happens to me. Why, I've joined the Church lots of times when I
      felt that way, but as soon as I begin to get well it's different. I am
      getting well now, and what I told you don't count any more. I got my own
      way of living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a way!&rdquo; sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it ain't your way, and maybe it ain't the best way, but it suits me
      bully. I can always get enough to eat by going and asking some one for it,
      and you can't beat that. No, sir. You know durn well you can't!&rdquo; becoming
      argumentative. &ldquo;It just makes me sick to think of paying for things like
      vittles and clothes. A feller's got to have clothes, anyhow, ain't he? You
      know mighty well he has, or he'll get pinched, and supposing I was to earn
      a lot of money, even as much as a dollar a day, I'd have to spend every
      blamed cent to live. One day I'd work, and then the next I'd swaller what
      I'd worked for. Where's the sense in that? And I'd have all sorts of
      ornery worries for fear I'd lose my job.&rdquo; A look of wistful yearning
      overspread his face. &ldquo;Just you give me the hot days that's coming, when a
      feller's warm clean through and sweats in the shade, and I won't ask for
      no money. You can have it all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night, when he left him, Roger Oakley carefully locked the door and
      pocketed the key, and the helpless wretch on the bed, despairing and
      miserable, and cut off from all earthly hope, turned his face to the white
      wall and sobbed aloud.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEY were standing
      on the street corner before the hotel. Oakley had just come up-town from
      the office. He was full of awkward excuses and apologies, but Mr. Emory
      cut them short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I've a right to be angry at the way you've avoided us, but I'm
      not. On the contrary, I'm going to take you home to dinner with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Dan find consulted his preferences in the matter, he would have begged
      off, but he felt he couldn't, without giving offence; so he allowed the
      doctor to lead him away, but he didn't appear as pleased or as grateful as
      he should have been at this temporary release from the low diet of the
      American House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Emory was waiting for her father on the porch. An errand of hers had
      taken him downtown.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed surprised to see Oakley, but graciously disposed towards him.
      While he fell short of her standards, he was decidedly superior to the
      local youth with whom she had at first been inclined to class him. Truth
      to tell, the local youth fought rather shy of the doctor's beautiful
      daughter. Mr. Burt Smith, the gentlemanly druggist and acknowledged social
      leader, who was much sought after by the most exclusive circles in such
      centres of fashion as Buckhorn and Harrison, had been so chilled by her
      manner when, meeting her on the street, he had attempted to revive an
      acquaintance which dated back to their childhood, that he was a mental
      wreck for days afterwards, and had hardly dared trust himself to fill even
      the simplest prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Monday Club and the Social Science Club and the History Club
      hinted that she might garner great sheaves of culture and enlightenment at
      their meetings, Constance merely smiled condescendingly, but held aloof,
      and the ladies of Antioch were intellectual without her abetment. They
      silently agreed with the Emorys' free-born help, who had seen better days,
      that she was &ldquo;haughty proud&rdquo; and &ldquo;stuck up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many was the informal indignation meeting they held, and many the
      vituperate discussion handed down concerning Miss Emory, but Miss Emory
      went her way with her head held high, apparently serenely unconscious of
      her offence against the peace and quiet of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed that she was intentionally unkind or arrogant. It
      was unfortunate, perhaps, but she didn't like the townspeople. She would
      have been perfectly willing to admit they were quite as good as she. The
      whole trouble was that they were different, and the merits of this
      difference had nothing to do with the case. Her stand in the matter
      shocked her mother and amused her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Emory excused himself and went into the house. Dan made himself
      comfortable on the steps at Miss Emory's side. In the very nearness there
      was something luxurious and satisfying. He was silent because he feared
      the antagonism of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of Antioch had eaten its supper, principally in its
      shirt-sleeves, and was gossiping over front gates, or lounging on front
      steps. When Antioch loafed it did so with great singleness of purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there through the town, back yards had been freshly ploughed for
      gardens. In some of these men and boys were burning last year's brush and
      litter. The smoke hung heavy and undispersed in the twilight. Already the
      younger hands from the car-shops had &ldquo;cleaned up,&rdquo; and, dressed in their
      best clothes, were hurrying back down-town to hang about the square and
      street corners until it was time to return home and go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off in the distance an occasional shrill whistle told where the ubiquitous
      small boy was calling a comrade out to play, and every now and then, with
      a stealthy patter of bare feet, some coatless urchin would scurry past the
      Emorys' gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was calm and restful, but it gave one a feeling of loneliness, too;
      Antioch seemed very remote from the great world where things happened, or
      were done. In spite of his satisfaction, Dan vaguely realized this. To the
      girl at his side, however, the situation was absolutely tragic. The life
      she had known had been so different, but it had been purchased at the
      expense of a good deal of inconvenience and denial on the part of her
      father and mother. It was impossible to ask a continuance of the
      sacrifice, and it was equally impossible to remain in Antioch. She did not
      want to be selfish, but the day was not far off when it would resolve
      itself into a question of simple self-preservation. She had not yet
      reached the point where she could consider marriage as a possible means of
      escape, and, even if she had, it would not have solved the problem, for
      whom was she to marry?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tired, fretful look in her eyes. She had lost something of her
      brilliancy and freshness. In her despair she told herself she was losing
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was with friends of yours this afternoon, Mr. Oakley,&rdquo; she said, by way
      of starting the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends of mine, here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The Joyces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go around and see them. They have been very kind to my father,&rdquo;
       said Dan, with hearty good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is your father to remain in Antioch, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo; inquired
      Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as I remain, I suppose. There are only the two of us, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he find to do here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; laughed Dan, &ldquo;he finds plenty to do. His energy is something
      dreadful. Then, too, he's employed at the shops; that keeps him pretty
      busy, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Emory hadn't known this before. She elevated her eyebrows in mild
      surprise. She was not sure she understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know that he was one of the officers of the road,&rdquo; with
      deceptive indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not. He's a cabinet-maker,&rdquo; explained the literal Oakley, to whom a
      cabinet-maker was quite as respectable as any one else. There was a brief
      pause, while Constance turned this over in her mind. It struck her as very
      singular that Oakley's father should be one of the hands. Perhaps she
      credited him with a sensitiveness of which he was entirely innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rested her chin in her hands and gazed out into the dusty street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it infinitely pathetic to think of that poor little man and his
      work?&rdquo; going back to Joyce. &ldquo;Do you know, I could have cried? And his
      wife's faith, it is sublime, even if it is mistaken.&rdquo; She laughed in a
      dreary fashion. &ldquo;What is to be done for people like that, whose lives are
      quite uncompensated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Oakley this opened up a field for future speculation, but he approved
      of her interest in Joyce. It was kindly and sincere, and it was
      unexpected. He had been inclined to view her as a proud young person,
      unduly impressed with the idea of her own beauty and superiority. It
      pleased him to think he had been mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were joined by the doctor, who had caught a part of what Constance
      said, and divined the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see only the pathos. Joyce is just as well off here as he would be
      anywhere else, and perhaps a little better. He makes a decent living with
      his pictures.&rdquo; As he spoke he crossed the porch and stood at her side,
      with his hand resting affectionately on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there's a larger justice in the world than we conceive,&rdquo; said
      Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not to know, to go on blindly doing something that is really very
      dreadful, and never to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Oakley. &ldquo;I am afraid I rather agree with your father. He
      seems happy enough, and he is doing work for which there is a demand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be content to live here with no greater opportunity than he
      has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley laughed and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But that's not the same. I'll pull the Huckleberry up and make it
      pay, and then go in for something bigger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you can't make it pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't bother with it, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you had to remain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley gave her an incredulous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That couldn't be possible. I have done all sorts of things but stick in
      what I found to be undesirable berths; but, of course, business is not at
      all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn't it? Look at Mr. Ryder. He says that he is buried here in the
      pine-woods, with no hope of ever getting back into the world, and I am
      sure he is able, and journalism is certainly a business, like anything
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley made no response to this. He didn't propose to criticise Ryder,
      but, all the same, he doubted his ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Griff's frightfully lazy,&rdquo; remarked the doctor. &ldquo;He prefers to settle
      down to an effortless sort of an existence rather than make a struggle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think Mr. Ryder extremely clever, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him so slightly, Miss Emory; but no doubt he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Emory appeared in the doorway, placid and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constance, you and Mr. Oakley come on in; dinner's ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dan went home that night he told himself savagely that he would never
      go to the Emorys' again. The experience had been most unsatisfactory. In
      spite of Constance's evident disposition towards tolerance where he was
      concerned, she exasperated him. Her unconscious condescension was a bitter
      memory of which he could not rid himself. Certainly women must be petty,
      small-souled creatures if she was at all representative of her sex. Yet,
      in spite of his determination to avoid Constance, even at the risk of
      seeming rude, he found it required greater strength of will than he
      possessed to keep away from the Emorys.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized, in the course of the next few weeks, that a new stage in his
      development had been reached. Inspired by what he felt was a false but
      beautiful confidence in himself, he called often, and, as time wore on,
      the frequency of these calls steadily increased. All this while he thought
      about Miss Emory a great deal, and was sorry for her or admired her,
      according to his mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Constance's attitude towards him there was a certain fickleness that he
      resented. Sometimes she was friendly and companionable, and then again she
      seemed to revive all her lingering prejudices and was utterly indifferent
      to him, and her indifference was the most complete thing of its kind he
      had ever encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally Dan and Ryder met very frequently, and when they met they
      clashed. It was not especially pleasant, of course, but Ryder was
      persistent and Oakley was dogged. Once he started in pursuit of an object,
      he never gave up or owned that he was beaten. In some form he had
      accomplished everything he set out to do; and if the results had not
      always been just what he had anticipated, he had at least had the
      satisfaction of bringing circumstances under his control. He endured the
      editor's sarcasms, and occasionally retaliated with a vengeance so heavy
      as to leave Griff quivering with the smart of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Emory found it difficult to maintain the peace between them, but she
      admired Dan's mode of warfare. It was so conclusive, and he showed such
      grim strength in his ability to look out for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dan felt that he must suffer by any comparison with the editor. He had
      no genius for trifles, but rather a ponderous capacity. He had worked
      hard, with the single determination to win success. He had the practical
      man's contempt, born of his satisfied ignorance for all useless things,
      and to his mind the useless things were those whose value it was
      impossible to reckon in dollars and cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been well content with himself, and now he felt that somehow he had
      lost his bearings. Why was it he had not known before that the mere
      strenuous climb, the mere earning of a salary, was not all of life? He
      even felt a sneaking envy of Ryder of which he was heartily ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men fall in love differently. Some resist and hang back from the
      inevitable, not being sure of themselves, and some go headlong, never
      having any doubts. With characteristic singleness of purpose, Dan went
      headlong; but of course he did not know what the trouble was until long
      after the facts in the case were patent to every one, and Antioch had lost
      interest in its speculations as to whether the doctor's daughter would
      take the editor or the general manager, for, as Mrs. Poppleton, the
      Emorys' nearest neighbor, sagely observed, she was &ldquo;having her pick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Oakley Miss Emory seemed to accumulate dignity and reserve in the exact
      proportion that he lost them, but he was determined she should like him if
      she never did more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just the least bit afraid of him. She knew he was not deficient in
      a proper pride, and that he possessed plenty of self-respect, but for all
      that he was not very dexterous. It amused her to lead him on, and then to
      draw back and leave him to flounder out of some untenable position she had
      beguiled him into assuming.
    </p>
    <p>
      She displayed undeniable skill in these manoeuvres, and Dan was by turns
      savage and penitent. But she never gave him a chance to say what he wanted
      to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryder made his appeal to her vanity. It was a strong appeal. He was
      essentially presentable and companionable. She understood him, and they
      had much in common, but for all that her heart approved of Oakley. She
      felt his dominance; she realized that he was direct and simple and strong.
      Yet in her judgment of him she was not very generous. She could not
      understand, for instance, how it was that he had been willing to allow his
      father to go to work in the shops like one of the common hands. It seemed
      to her to argue such an awful poverty in the way of ideals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old convict was another stumbling-block. She had met him at the
      Joyces', and had been quick to recognize that he and Dan were very much
      alike&mdash;the difference was merely that of age and youth. Indeed, the
      similarity was little short of painful. There was the same simplicity, the
      same dogged stubbornness, and the same devotion to what she conceived to
      be an almost brutal sense of duty. In the case of the father this idea of
      duty had crystallized in a strangely literal belief in the Deity and
      expressed itself with rampant boastfulness at the very discomforts of a
      faith which, like the worship of Juggernaut, demanded untold sacrifices
      and apparently gave nothing in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to stifle her growing liking for Oakley and her unwilling
      admiration for his strength and honesty and a certain native refinement.
      Unconsciously, perhaps, she had always associated qualities of this sort
      with position and wealth. She divined his lack of early opportunity, and
      was alive to his many crudities of speech and manner, and he suffered, as
      he knew he must suffer, by comparison with the editor; but, in spite of
      this, Constance Emory knew deep down in her heart that he possessed solid
      and substantial merits of his own.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">K</span>ENYON came to town
      to remind his Antioch friends and supporters that presently he would be
      needing their votes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was Ryder's guest for a week, and the <i>Herald</i> recorded his
      movements with painstaking accuracy and with what its editor secretly
      considered metropolitan enterprise. The great man had his official
      headquarters at the <i>Herald</i> office, a ramshackle two-story building
      on the west side of the square. Here he was at home to the local
      politicians, and to such of the general public as wished to meet him. The
      former smoked his cigars and talked incessantly of primaries, nominations,
      and majorities&mdash;topics on which they appeared to be profoundly
      versed. Their distinguishing mark was their capacity for strong drink,
      which was far in excess of that of the ordinary citizen who took only a
      casual interest in politics. The <i>Herald's</i> back door opened into an
      alley, and was directly opposite that of the Red Star saloon. At stated
      intervals Mr. Kenyon and Mr. Ryder, followed by the faithful, trailed
      through this back door and across the alley, where they cheerfully exposed
      themselves to such of the gilded allurements of vice as the Red Star had
      to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men of Antioch eschewed front doors as giving undue publicity to the
      state of their thirst, a point on which they must have been very
      sensitive, for though a number of saloons flourished in the town, only a
      few of the most reckless and emancipated spirits were ever seen to enter
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenyon was a sloppily dressed man of forty-five or thereabouts, who
      preserved an air of rustic shrewdness. He was angular-faced and
      smooth-shaven, and wore his hair rather long in a tangled mop. He was
      generally described in the party papers as &ldquo;The Picturesque Statesman from
      Old Hanover.&rdquo; He had served one term in Congress; prior to that, by way of
      apprenticeship, he had done a great deal of hard work and dirty work for
      his party. His fortunes had been built on the fortunes of a bigger and an
      abler man, who, after a fight which was already famous in the history of
      the State for its bitterness, had been elected Governor, and Kenyon,
      having picked the winner, had gone to his reward. Just now he had a shrewd
      idea that the Governor was anxious to unload him, and that the party
      leaders were sharpening their knives for him. Their change of heart grew
      out of the fact that he had &ldquo;dared to assert his independence,&rdquo; as he
      said, and had &ldquo;played the sneak and broken his promises,&rdquo; as they said, in
      a little transaction which had been left to him to put through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally Ryder counted him an unmitigated scamp, but the man's breezy
      vulgarity, his nerve, and his infinite capacity to jolly tickled his
      fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had so far freed himself of his habitual indifference that he was
      displaying an unheard-of energy in promoting Kenyon's interest. Of course
      he expected to derive certain very substantial benefits from the alliance.
      The Congressman had made him endless promises, and Ryder saw, or thought
      he saw, his way clear to leave Antioch in the near future. For two days he
      had been saying, &ldquo;Mr. Brown, shake hands with Congressman Kenyon,&rdquo; or,
      &ldquo;Mr. Jones, I want you to know Congressman Kenyon, the man we must keep at
      Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had marvelled at the speed with which the statesman got down to first
      names. He had also shown a positive instinct as to whom he should invite
      to make the trip across the alley to the Red Star, and whom not. Mr.
      Kenyon said, modestly, when Griff commented on this, that his methods were
      modern&mdash;they were certainly vulgar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I'm going to give 'em a run for their money, Ryder. I can see I'm
      doing good work here. There's nothing like being on the ground yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of him that he should ignore the work Ryder had done
      in his behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an inspiration, Sam. The people know their leader,&rdquo; said the
      editor, genially, but with a touch of sarcasm that was lost on Kenyon, who
      took himself quite seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, they'd 'a' done me dirt,&rdquo; feelingly, &ldquo;but I am on my own range
      now, and ready to pull off my coat and fight for what's due me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were seated before the open door which looked out upon the square.
      Kenyon was chewing nervously at the end of an unlit cigar, which he held
      between his fingers. &ldquo;When the nomination is made I guess the other fellow
      will discover I 'ain't been letting the grass grow in my path.&rdquo; He spat
      out over the door-sill into the street. &ldquo;What's that you were just telling
      me about the Huckleberry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This new manager of Cornish's is going to make the road pay, and he's
      going to do it from the pockets of the employés,&rdquo; said Ryder, with a
      disgruntled air, for the memory of his interview with Dan still rankled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain't bad, either. You know the Governor's pretty close to Cornish.
      The general was a big contributor to his campaign fund.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder hitched his chair nearer his companion's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there's a cut in wages at the shops&mdash;and I suppose that will be
      the next move&mdash;there's bound to be a lot of bad feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't forget we are for the people.&rdquo; remarked the Congressman, and
      he winked slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryder smiled cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha'n't. I have it in for the manager, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing, but a whole lot,&rdquo; answered Griff, with apparent
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Dr. Emory crossed the square from the post-office and
      paused in front of the <i>Herald</i> building.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's Dr. Emory?&rdquo; said Kenyon, by way of greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryder had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you come in and sit down, doctor?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Keep your seat, Griff. I merely strolled over to say how d'ye
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenyon shot past the doctor a discolored stream. That gentleman moved
      uneasily to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't move,&rdquo; said the statesman, affably. &ldquo;Plenty of room between you and
      the casing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left his chair and stood facing the doctor, and unpleasantly close.
      &ldquo;Say, our young friend here's turned what I intended to be a vacation into
      a very busy time. He's got me down for speeches and all sorts of things,
      and it will be a wonder if I go home to Hanover sober. I won't if he can
      help it, that's dead sure. Won't you come in and have something?&mdash;just
      a little appetizer before supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cigar, then?&rdquo; fumbling in his vest-pocket with fingers that were just
      the least bit unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must hurry along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hope to get up again before Mr. Kenyon leaves town,&rdquo; said Ryder,
      wishing to head the statesman off. He was all right with such men as Cap
      Roberts and the Hon. Jeb Burrows, but he had failed signally to take the
      doctor's measure. The latter turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will, Griff,&rdquo; he said, kindly, his voice dwelling with the
      least perceptible insistence on the last pronoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember me to the wife and daughter,&rdquo; called out Kenyon, as the
      physician moved up the street with an unusual alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon, and the men from the car-shops were
      beginning to straggle past, going in the direction of their various homes.
      Presently Roger Oakley strode heavily by, with his tin dinner-pail on his
      arm. Otherwise there was nothing, either in his dress or appearance, to
      indicate that he was one of the hands. As he still lived at the hotel with
      Dan, he felt it necessary to exercise a certain care in the matter of
      dress. As he came into view the Congressman swept him with a casual
      scrutiny; then, as the old man plodded on up the street with deliberate
      step, Kenyon rose from his chair and stood in the doorway gazing after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Sam?&rdquo; asked Ryder, struck by his friend's manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that old man who just went past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That? Oh, that's the manager's father. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he looks most awfully like some one else, that's all,&rdquo; and he
      appeared to lose interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he's old man Oakley. He works in the shops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oakley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's his name. Why?&rdquo; curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has he been here, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month perhaps, maybe longer. Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've seen him before. A cousin of mine, John Kenyon, is warden of a
      prison back in Massachusetts. It runs in the blood to hold office. I
      visited him last winter, and while I was there a fire broke out in the
      hospital ward, and that old man had a hand in saving the lives of two or
      three of the patients. The beggars came within an ace of losing their
      lives. I saw afterwards by the papers that the Governor had pardoned him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder jumped up with sudden alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the convict's full name?&rdquo; Kenyon meditated a moment; then
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roger Oakley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor turned to the files of the <i>Herald</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll just look back and see if it's the same name. I've probably got it
      here among the personals, if I can only find it. What was he imprisoned
      for?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was serving a life sentence for murder, I think, John told me, but I
      won't be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil, you say!&rdquo; ejaculated Ryder. &ldquo;Yes, Roger Oakley, the name's the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew I couldn't be mistaken. I got a pretty good memory for names and
      faces. Curious, ain't it, that he should turn up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder smiled queerly as he dropped the <i>Herald</i> files back into the
      rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His son is manager for Cornish here. He's the fellow I was telling you
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenyon smiled, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you won't have any more trouble with him. You've got him where
      you can hit him, and hit him hard whenever you like.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>OGER OAKLEY
      carried out his threat to find work for Jeffy. As soon as the outcast was
      able to leave his bed, he took him down to the car-shops, which were
      destined to be the scene of this brief but interesting industrial
      experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early morning, and they found only Clarence there. He was sweeping
      out the office&mdash;a labor he should have performed the night before,
      but, unless he was forcibly detained, he much preferred to let it go over,
      on the principle that everything that is put off till the morrow is just
      so much of a gain, and, in the end, tends to reduce the total of human
      effort, as some task must necessarily be left undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roger Oakley pushed open the door and entered the office in search of
      his son, his charge, who slunk and shuffled after him with legs which bore
      him but uncertainly, cast a long and lingering look back upon the freedom
      he was leaving. The dignity of labor, on which his patron had been
      expatiating as they walked in the shortening shadows under the maples,
      seemed a scanty recompense for all he was losing. A deep, wistful sigh
      escaped his lips. He turned his back on the out-of-doors and peered over
      the old man's shoulder at Clarence with bleary eyes. Of course, he knew
      Clarence. This was a privilege not denied the humblest. Occasionally the
      urchin called him names, more often he pelted him with stones. The
      opportunities for excitement were limited in Antioch, and the juvenile
      population heedfully made the most of those which existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeffy was a recognized source of excitement. It was not as if one stole
      fruit or ran away from school. Then there was some one to object, and
      consequences; but if one had fun with Jeffy there was none to object but
      Jeffy, and, of course, he didn't count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my son here, Clarence?&rdquo; asked Roger Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope. The whistle ain't blowed yet. I am trying to get the place cleaned
      up before he comes down,&rdquo; making slaps at the desks and chairs with a
      large wet cloth. &ldquo;What you going to do with him, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded towards Jeffy, who seemed awed by the unaccustomedness of his
      surroundings, for he kept himself hidden back of the old man, his battered
      and brimless straw hat held nervously in his trembling fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to get work for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him work! Him! Why, he don't want no work, Mr. Oakley. He's too strong to
      work.&rdquo; And Clarence went off into gales of merriment at the mere idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Jeffy gazed in silence at the boy with quickly mounting
      wrath, then he said, in a hoarse <i>tremolo</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You durned little loafer! Don't you give me none of your lip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarence had sufficiently subsided to remark, casually: &ldquo;The old man'd
      like to know what you got for that horse-blanket and whip you stole from
      our barn. You're a bird, you are! When he was willing to let you sleep in
      the barn because he was sorry for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie, durn you!&rdquo; fiercely. &ldquo;I didn't steal no whip or horse-blanket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you did, too! The old man found out who you sold 'em to,&rdquo; smiling
      with exasperating coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outcast turned to Roger Oakley. &ldquo;Nobody's willing to let by-gones be
      by-gones,&rdquo; and two large tears slid from his moist eyes. Then his manner
      changed abruptly. He became defiant, and, step-ing from behind his
      protector, shook a long and very dirty forefinger in Clarence's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just tell Chris Berry this from me&mdash;I'm done with him. I don't
      like no sneaks, and you just tell him this&mdash;he sha'n't never bury
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he ain't sweatin' to bury any paupers,&rdquo; hastily interjected the
      grinning Clarence. &ldquo;The old man ain't in the business for his health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he don't stop slandering me&rdquo;&mdash;his voice shot up out of its
      huskiness&mdash;&ldquo;if he don't stop slandering me, I'll fix him!&rdquo; He turned
      again to Roger Oakley. &ldquo;Them Berrys is a low-lived lot! I hope you won't
      never have doings with 'em. They'll smile in your face and then do you
      dirt behind your back; I've done a lot for Chris Berry, but I'm durned if
      I ever lift my hand for him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he was too excited to specify the exact nature of the benefits
      which he had conferred upon the undertaker. Clarence ignored the attack
      upon his family. He contented himself with remarking, judiciously:
      &ldquo;Anybody who can slander you's got a future ahead of him. He's got unusual
      gifts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Roger Oakley saw fit to interfere in behalf of his protégé. He shook
      his head in grave admonition at the grinning youngster. &ldquo;Jeffy is going to
      make a man of himself. It's not right to remember these things against
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know rotten well that's what I'm always telling 'em. Let by-gones be
      by-gones&mdash;that's my motto&mdash;but they are so ornery they won't
      never give me a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to be a great shock to the community when Jeffy starts to
      work, Mr. Oakley,&rdquo; observed Clarence, politely. &ldquo;He's never done anything
      harder than wheel smoke from the gas-house. Where you going to put up,
      Jeffy, when you get your wages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your durn lip!&rdquo; screamed Jeffy, white with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you'll want to return the horse-blanket and whip. You can leave
      'em here with me. I'll take 'em home to the old man,&rdquo; remarked the boy,
      affably. &ldquo;I wouldn't trust you with ten cents; you know mighty well I
      wouldn't,&rdquo; retorted Jeffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good reason why&mdash;you ain't never had that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan Oakley's step was heard approaching the door, and the wordy warfare
      ceased abruptly. Clarence got out of the way as quickly as possible, for
      he feared he might be asked to do something, and he had other plans for
      the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeffy was handed over to McClintock's tender mercies, who put him to work
      in the yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pay-day in the car-shops, and Oakley posted a number of notices in
      conspicuous places about the works. They announced a ten-per-cent,
      reduction in the wages of the men, the cut to go into effect immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by McClintock came in from the yards. He was hot and perspiring,
      and his check shirt clung moistly to his powerful shoulders. As he crossed
      to the water-cooler, he said to Dan:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we've lost him already. I guess he wasn't keen for work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley looked up inquiringly from the letter he was writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean Jeffy. He stuck to it for a couple of hours, and then Pete saw him
      making a sneak through the cornfield towards the crick. I haven't told
      your father yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would be that way. Have you seen the notices?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard anything from the men yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McClintock returned to the yards. It was the noon hour, and in the shade
      of one of the sheds he found a number of the hands at lunch, who lived too
      far from the shops to go home to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Milt,&rdquo; said one of these, &ldquo;have you tumbled to the notices?&mdash;ten
      per cent, all round. You'll be having to go down in your sock for coin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's there all right,&rdquo; cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew when Cornish came down here there would be something drop shortly.
      I ain't never known it to fail. The old skinflint! I'll bet he ain't
      losing any money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet he ain't, not he,&rdquo; said a second, with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first man, Branyon by name, bit carefully into the wedge-shaped piece
      of pie he was holding in his hand. &ldquo;If I was as rich as Cornish I'm damned
      if I'd be such an infernal stiff! What the hell good is his money doing
      him, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the boss say, Milt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wages will go back as soon as he can put them back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they will! Like fun!&rdquo; said Branyon, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a lot of kickers, you are,&rdquo; commented McClintock, good-naturedly.
      &ldquo;You don't believe for one minute, do you, that the Huckleberry or the
      shops ever earned a dollar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can gamble on it that they ain't ever cost Cornish a red cent,&rdquo; said
      Branyon, as positively as a mouthful of pie would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be too sure about that,&rdquo; said the master-mechanic, walking on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet he ain't out none on this,&rdquo; remarked Branyon, cynically. &ldquo;If he was
      he wouldn't take it so blamed easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men began to straggle back from their various homes and to form in
      little groups about the yards and in the shops. They talked over the cut
      and argued the merits of the case, as men will, made their comments on
      Cornish, who was generally conceded to be as mean in money matters as he
      was fortunate, and then went back to their work when the one-o'clock
      whistle blew, in a state of high good-humor with themselves and their
      critical ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the <i>Herald</i> dealt with the situation at some length.
      The whole tone of the editorial was rancorous and bitter. It spoke of the
      parsimony of the new management, which had been instanced by a number of
      recent dismissals among men who had served the road long and faithfully,
      and who deserved other and more considerate treatment. It declared that
      the cut was but the beginning of the troubles in store for the hands, and
      characterized it as an attempt on the part of the new management to curry
      favor with Cornish, who was notoriously hostile to the best interests of
      labor. It wound up by regretting that the men were not organized, as
      proper organization would have enabled them to meet this move on the part
      of the management.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Oakley read the obnoxious editorial his blood grew hot and his mood
      belligerent. It showed evident and unusual care in the preparation, and he
      guessed correctly that it had been written and put in type in readiness
      for the cut. It was a direct personal attack, too, for the expression &ldquo;the
      new management,&rdquo; which was used over and over, could mean but the one
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan's first impulse was to hunt Ryder up and give him a sound thrashing,
      but his better sense told him that while this rational mode of expressing
      his indignation would have been excusable enough a few years back, when he
      was only a brakeman, as the manager of the Buckhom and Antioch Railroad it
      was necessary to pursue a more pacific policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew he could be made very unpopular if these attacks were persisted
      in. This he did not mind especially, except as it would interfere with the
      carrying out of his plans and increase his difficulties. After thinking it
      over he concluded that he would better see Ryder and have a talk with him.
      It would do no harm, he argued, and it might do some good, provided, of
      course, that he could keep his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went directly to the <i>Herald</i> office, and found Griff in and
      alone. When Dan strode into the office, looking rather warm, the latter
      turned a trifle pale, for he had his doubts about the manager's temper,
      and no doubts at all about his muscular development, which was imposing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came in to see what you meant by this, Ryder,&rdquo; his caller said, and he
      held out the paper folded to the insulting article. Ryder assumed to
      examine it carefully, but he knew every word there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this? Oh yes! The story of the reduction in wages down at the
      car-shops. There! You can take it from under my nose; I can see quite
      clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; repeated Ryder after him, with exasperating composure. The editor
      was no stranger to intrusions of this sort, for his sarcasms were
      frequently personal. His manner varied to suit each individual case. When
      the wronged party stormed into the office, wrathful and loud-lunged, he
      was generally willing to make prompt reparation, especially if his visitor
      had the advantage of physical preponderance on his side. When, however,
      the caller was uncertain and palpably in awe of him, as sometimes
      happened, he got no sort of satisfaction. With Oakley he pursued a middle
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it speaks for itself, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went into this matter with you, and you know as well as I do why the
      men are cut. This,&rdquo; striking the paper contemptuously with his open hand,
      &ldquo;is the worst sort of rubbish, but it may serve to make the men feel that
      they are being wronged, and it is an attack on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice that? I didn't know but it was too subtle for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He couldn't resist the gibe at Oakley's expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disguised, of course, but intended to give the men less confidence in me.
      Now, I'm not going to stand any more of this sort of thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious he had brought his remarks to a decidedly lame
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Oakley, I'm editor of the <i>Herald</i>,
      and I don't allow any man to dictate to me what I shall print. That's a
      point I'll pass on for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the situation. You know that the general will dispose of his
      interests here unless they can be made self-sustaining; and, whether you
      like him or not, he stands as a special providence to the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know what you have told me,&rdquo; sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley bit his lips. He saw it would have been better to have left Ryder
      alone. He felt his own weakness, and his inability to force him against
      his will to be fair. He gulped down his anger and chagrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see what you can gain by stirring up this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand you are hostile to the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that means you&mdash;yes. You haven't helped yourself by coming here
      as though you could bully me into your way of thinking. I didn't get much
      satisfaction from my call on you. You let me know you could attend to your
      own affairs, and I can attend to mine just as easily. I hope you
      appreciate that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan turned on his heel and left the office, cursing himself for his
      stupidity in having given the editor an opportunity to get even.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the course of
      the next few days Dan decided that there was no danger of trouble from the
      hands. Things settled back into their accustomed rut. He was only a little
      less popular, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was indebted to Clarence for the first warning he received as to what
      was in store for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came about in this way. Clarence had retired to the yards, where,
      secure from observation, he was indulging in a quiet smoke, furtively
      keeping an eye open for McClintock, whose movements were uncertain, as he
      knew from sad experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      A high board fence was in front of him, shutting off the yards from the
      lower end of the town. At his back was a freight car, back of that again
      were the interlacing tracks, and beyond them a cornfield and Billup's
      Fork, with its inviting shade of sycamores and willows and its tempting
      swimming-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he heard a scrambling on the opposite side of the fence, and ten
      brown fingers clutched the tops of the boards, then a battered straw hat
      came on a level with the fingers, at the same instant a bare foot and leg
      were thrown over the fence, and the owner of the battered straw hat swung
      himself into view. All this while a dog whined and yelped; then followed a
      vigorous scratching sound, and presently a small, dilapidated-looking
      yellow cur squeezed itself beneath the fence. Clarence recognized the
      intruders. It was Branyon's boy, Augustus, commonly called &ldquo;Spide,&rdquo;
       because of his exceeding slimness and the length of his legs, and his dog
      Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Branyon's boy saw Clarence he balanced himself deftly on the
      top of the fence with one hand and shaded his eyes elaborately with the
      other. An amiable, if toothless, smile curled his lips. When he spoke it
      was with deep facetiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi! come out from behind that roll of paper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Clarence said not a word. He puffed away at his cigarette, apparently
      oblivious of everything save the contentment it gave him, and as he puffed
      Spide's mouth worked and watered sympathetically. His secret admiration
      was tremendous. Here was Clarence in actual and undisturbed possession of
      a whole cigarette. He had to purchase his cigarettes in partnership with
      some other boy, and go halves on the smoking of them. It made him feel
      cheap and common.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say I got one of them coffin-tacks that ain't working?&rdquo; he inquired.
      Clarence gazed off up the tracks, ignoring the question and the
      questioner. Spide's presence was balm to his soul. But as one of the
      office force of the Buckhom and Antioch he felt a certain lofty reserve to
      be incumbent upon him. Besides, he and Spide had been engaged in a recent
      rivalry for Susie Poppleton's affections. It is true he had achieved a
      brilliant success over his rival, but that a mere school-boy should have
      ventured to oppose him, a salaried man, had struck him as an unpardonable
      piece of impertinence for which there could be no excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spide, however, had taken the matter most philosophically. He had
      recognized that he could not hope to compete with a youth who possessed
      unlimited wealth, which he was willing to lay out on chewing-gum and
      candy, his experience being that the sex was strictly mercenary and
      incapable of a disinterested love. Of course he had much admired Miss
      Poppleton; from the crown of her small dark head, with its tightly braided
      &ldquo;pig-tails,&rdquo; down to her trim little foot he had esteemed her as wholly
      adorable; but, after all, his affair of the heart had been an affair of
      the winter only. With the coming of summer he had found more serious
      things to think of. He was learning to swim and to chew tobacco. The
      mastering of these accomplishments pretty well occupied his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;got another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Clarence blinked at the fierce sunlight which danced on the rails,
      and said nothing. Spide slid skilfully down from his perch, but his manner
      had undergone a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who throwed that snipe away, anyhow?&rdquo; he asked, disdainfully. Clarence
      turned his eyes slowly in his direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lookee here. You fellows got to keep out of these yards, or I'll tell
      McClintock. First we know some of you kids will be getting run over, and
      then your folks will set up a lively howl. Get on out! It ain't no place
      for little boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put the cigarette between his lips and took a deep and tantalizing pull
      at it. Spide kept to his own side of the ditch that ran between the fence
      and the tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; with infinite scorn. &ldquo;Who's a kid? You won't be happy till I come
      over there and lick you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First thing I know you'll be stealing scrap iron!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gosh! The Huckleberry'd have to stop running if I swiped a
      coupling-pin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarence had recourse to the cigarette, and again Spide was consumed with
      torturing jealousies. &ldquo;Where did you shoot that snipe, anyhow?&rdquo; he
      inquired, insultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Clarence allowed his glance to stray off up the tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For half a cent I'd come across and do what I say!&rdquo; added Spide, stooping
      down to roll up his trousers leg, and then easing an unelastic &ldquo;gallus&rdquo;
       that cut his shoulders. This elicited a short and contemptuous grunt from
      Clarence. He was well pleased with himself. He felt Spide's envy. It was
      sweet and satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; with sudden animation. &ldquo;You fellers will be going around on your
      uppers in a day or so. I'll bet you'd give a heap to know what I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't give a darned cent to know all you know or ever will know!&rdquo;
       retorted Clarence, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people's easily upset here in the cupola,&rdquo; tapping his brimless
      covering. &ldquo;I wouldn't want to give you brain-fever; I don't hate you bad
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, move on. You ain't wanted around here. It may get me into trouble
      if I'm seen fooling away my time on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to hell it will,&rdquo; remarked Branyon's boy, Augustus, with cordial
      ill-will and fluent profanity. He was not a good little boy. He himself
      would have been the first to spurn the idea of personal sanctity. But he
      was literally bursting with the importance of the facts which he
      possessed, and Clarence's indifference gave him no opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you bet there ain't a strike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't betting this morning,&rdquo; said Clarence, blandly. &ldquo;But if there is
      one we are ready for it. You bet the hands won't catch us napping. We are
      ready for 'em any time and all the time.&rdquo; This, delivered with a large
      air, impressed Spide exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sent for the militia a'ready?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's saying,&rdquo; noting the effect of his words. &ldquo;I can't go blabbing
      about, telling what the road's up to, but we are awake, and the hands will
      get it in the neck if they tackle the boss. He's got dam little use for
      laboring men, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Clarence, Oakley was the most august person he had ever known. He
      religiously believed his position to be only second in point of importance
      and power to that of the President of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wont to invest him with purely imaginary attributes, and to lie
      about him at a great rate among his comrades, who were ready to credit any
      report touching a man who was reputed to be able to ride on the cars
      without a ticket. Human grandeur had no limits beyond this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a meeting last night. I bet you didn't know that,&rdquo; said Spide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard something of it. Was your father at the meeting, Spide?&rdquo; he
      asked, dropping his tone of hostility for one of gracious familiarity. The
      urchin promptly crossed the ditch and stood at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course the old man was. You don't suppose he wouldn't be in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, let 'em kick. You see the boss is ready for 'em,&rdquo; remarked
      Clarence, indifferently. He wanted to know what Spide knew, but he didn't
      feel that he could afford to show any special interest. &ldquo;Where you going&mdash;swimming?&rdquo;
       he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; But Spide was not ready to drop the fascinating subject of the
      strike. He wished to astonish Clarence, who was altogether too knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meeting was in the room over Jack Britt's saloon,&rdquo; he volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you think we didn't know that up at the office. We got our
      spies out. There ain't nothing the hands can do we ain't on to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spide wrote his initials in the soft bank of the ditch with his big toe,
      while he meditated on what he could tell next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, you'd 'a' been surprised if you'd 'a' been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was you there, Spide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come off; you can't stuff me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, too, there. The old lady sent me down to fetch pap home. She was
      afraid he'd get full. Joe Stokes was there, and Lou Bentick, and a whole
      slew of others, and Griff Ryder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarence gasped with astonishment. &ldquo;Why, he ain't one of the hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's on their side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you giving us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, they are going to make a stiff kick on old man Oakley working in the
      shops. They got it in for him good and strong.&rdquo; He paused to weigh the
      effect of this, and then went on rapidly: &ldquo;He's done something. Ryder
      knows about it. He told my old man and Joe Stokes. They say he's got to
      get out. What's a convicted criminal, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to know that for, Spide?&rdquo; questioned the artful
      Clarence, with great presence of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's what old man Oakley is. I heard Ryder say so myself, and pap
      and Joe Stokes just kicked themselves because they hadn't noticed it
      before, I suppose. My! but they were hot! Say, you'll see fun to-morrow. I
      shouldn't be surprised if they sent you all a-kiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarence was swelling with the desire to tell Oakley what he had heard. He
      took the part of a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have one?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spide promptly availed himself of his companion's liberality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; the latter added. &ldquo;I got to get back,&rdquo; and a moment later
      he might have been seen making his way cautiously in the direction of the
      office, while Spide, his battered hat under his arm, and the cigarette
      clutched in one hand, was skipping gayly across the cornfield towards the
      creek followed by Pink. He was bound for the &ldquo;Slidy,&rdquo; a swimming-hole his
      mother had charged him on no account to visit. Under these peculiar
      circumstances it was quite impossible for him to consider any other spot.
      Nowhere else was the shade so cool and dense, nowhere else did the wild
      mint scent the summer air with such seductive odors, and nowhere else were
      such social advantages to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were always big boys hanging about the &ldquo;Slidy&rdquo; who played cards and
      fished and loafed, but mostly loafed, because it was the easiest, and here
      Mr. Tink Brown, Jeffy's logical successor and unofficial heir apparent,
      held court from the first of June to the last of August. The charm of his
      society no respectable small boy was able to withstand. His glittering
      indecencies made him a sort of hero, and his splendid lawless state was
      counted worthy of emulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Spide discovered that the way of the transgressor is sometimes as hard
      as the moralists would have us believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the beginning of the season, and a group of boys, in easy undress,
      were clustered on the bank above the swimming-hole. They were &ldquo;going in&rdquo;
       as soon as an important question should be decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer whose fields skirted Billup's Fork at this point usually filled
      in the &ldquo;Slidy&rdquo; every spring with bits of rusty barb-wire and osage-orange
      cuttings. The youth of Antioch who were prejudiced maintained that he did
      it to be mean, but the real reason was that he wished to discourage the
      swimmers, who tramped his crops and stole his great yellow pumpkins to
      play with in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time-honored method of determining the condition of the hole was
      beautifully simple. It was to catch a small boy and throw him in, and
      until this rite was performed the big boys used the place but gingerly.
      Mr. Brown and his friends were waiting for this small boy to happen along,
      when the unsuspecting Spide ran down the bank. He was promptly seized by
      the mighty Tink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been in yet, Spide?&rdquo; asked his captor, genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then this is your chance.&rdquo; Whereat Spide began to cry. He didn't want to
      go in. All at once he remembered he had promised his mother he wouldn't
      and that his father had promised him a licking if he did&mdash;two
      excellent reasons why he should stay out&mdash;but Tink only pushed him
      towards the water's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're hurting me! Lemme alone, you big loafer! Lemme go, or I'll tell
      the old man on you!&rdquo; and he scratched and clawed, but Tink merely laughed,
      and the other boys advised him to &ldquo;chuck the little shaver in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemme take off my shirt and pants! Lemme take off my pants&mdash;just my
      pants, Tink!&rdquo; he entreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was raised on high and hurled out into the stream where the
      sunlight flashed among the shadows cast by the willows. His hat went one
      way and his cigarette another. Pink was considerately tossed after him,
      and all his earthly possessions were afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a splash, and he disappeared from sight to reappear a second
      later, with streaming hair and dripping face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it?&rdquo; chorussed the big boys, who were already pulling off their
      clothes, as they saw that neither barb-wire nor osage-orange brush
      festooned the swimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; ecstatically, and he dived dexterously into the crown of his
      upturned hat, which a puff of wind had sent dancing gayly down-stream.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>AY!&rdquo; Clarence
      blurted out, &ldquo;there's going to be a strike!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley glanced up from his writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that you are telling me, Clarence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's going to be a strike, Mr. Oakley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan smiled good-naturedly at the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that has blown over, Clarence,&rdquo; he said, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it ain't. The men had a meeting last night. It was in the room over
      Jack Britt's saloon. I've just been talking with a fellow who was there;
      he told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Oakley, pushing a chair towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what is it?&rdquo; as soon as he was seated. And Clarence, editing his
      reminiscences as he saw fit, gave a tolerably truthful account of his
      conversation with Spide. The source of his information, its general
      incompleteness, and the frequent divergences, occasioned by the boy's
      attempt to incorporate into the narrative a satisfactory reason for his
      own presence in the yards, did not detract from its value in Oakley's
      estimation. The mere fact that the men had held a meeting was in itself
      significant. Such a thing was new to Antioch, as yet unvisited by labor
      troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that you say about my father?&rdquo; For he had rather lost track of
      the story and caught at the sudden mention of his father's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spide says they got it in for him. I can't just remember what he did say.
      It was something or other Griff Ryder knows about him. It's funny, but
      it's clean gone out of my head, Mr. Oakley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley started. What could Ryder know about his father? What could any one
      know?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not left long in doubt. The next morning, shortly after he arrived
      at the office, he heard the heavy shuffling of many feet on the narrow
      platform outside his door, and a deputation from the carpenter-shop, led
      by Joe Stokes and Branyon, entered the room. For a moment or so the men
      stood in abashed silence about the door, and then moved over to his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley pushed back his chair, and, as they approached, came slowly to his
      feet. There was a hint of anger in his eyes. The whole proceeding smacked
      of insolence. The men were in their shirt-sleeves and overalls, and had on
      their hats. Stokes put up his hand and took off his hat. The others
      accepted this as a signal, and one after another removed theirs. Then
      followed a momentary shuffling as they bunched closer. Several, who looked
      as if they would just as soon be somewhere else, breathed deep and hard.
      The office force&mdash;Kerr, Holt, and Miss Walton&mdash;suspended their
      various tasks and stood up so as not to miss anything that was said of
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, men, what is it?&rdquo; asked Oakley, sharply&mdash;so sharply that
      Clarence, who was at the water-cooler, started. He had never heard the
      manager use that tone before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stokes took a step forward and cleared his throat, as if to speak. Then he
      looked at his comrades, who looked back their encouragement at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want a word with you, Mr. Oakley,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, we got a grievance,&rdquo; began Stokes, weakly, but Branyon pushed
      him to one side hastily and took his place. He was a stockily built
      Irish-American, with plenty of nerve and a loose tongue. The men nudged
      each other. They knew Mike would have his say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just this, Mr. Oakley: There's a man in the carpenter-shop who's got
      to get out. We won't work with him no longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; muttered one or two of the men under their breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo; asked Oakley, and his tone was tense and strenuous,
      for he knew. There was an awkward silence. Branyon fingered his hat a
      trifle nervously. At last he said, doggedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who's got to go is your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Oakley, sinking his voice. He guessed what was coming next,
      but the question seemed dragged from him. He had to ask it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got nothing against you, Mr. Oakley, but we won't work in the same
      shop with a convicted criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; muttered the chorus of men again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley's face flushed scarlet. Then every scrap of color left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo; he ordered, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't we get our answer?&rdquo; demanded Branyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the interview was in progress, McClintock had entered, and now stood
      at the opposite end of the room, an attentive listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Oakley, hoarsely. &ldquo;I'll put whom I please to work in the
      shops. Leave the room all of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men retreated before his fury, their self-confidence rather dashed by
      it. One by one they backed sheepishly out of the door, Branyon being the
      last to leave. As he quitted the room he called to Dan:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll give you until to-morrow to think it over, but the old man's got to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McClintock promptly followed Branyon, and Clarence darted after him. He
      was in time to witness the uncorking of the master-mechanic's vials of
      wrath, and to hear the hot exchange of words which followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can count your days with the Huckleberry numbered, Branyon,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I'm damned if I'll have you under me after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see about that,&rdquo; retorted Branyon, roughly. &ldquo;Talk's cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the old man ever done to you, you infernal loafer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Milt, and keep your shirt on!&rdquo; said Stokes, in what he intended
      should be conciliatory tones. &ldquo;We only want our rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have 'em, too,&rdquo; said Branyon, shaking his head ominously. &ldquo;We ain't
      Dagoes or Pollacks. We're American mechanics, and we know our rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a sneak, Branyon. What's he ever done to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you go to hell!&rdquo; ruffling up his shirt-sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said McClintock, his gray eyes flashing, &ldquo;you needn't be so
      particular about the old man's record. You know as much about the inside
      of a prison as he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a damn liar!&rdquo; Nevertheless McClintock spoke only the truth. At
      Branyon's last word he smashed his fist into the middle of the carpenter's
      sour visage with a heavy, sickening thud. No man called him a liar and got
      away with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; gasped the closely attentive but critical Clarence. &ldquo;What a
      soaker!&rdquo; Branyon fell up against the side of the building near which they
      were standing. Otherwise he would have gone his length upon the ground,
      and the hands rushed in between the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stokes and Bentick dragged their friend away by main strength. The affair
      had gone far enough. They didn't want a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      McClintock marched into the office, crossed to the water-cooler, and
      filled himself a tumbler; then he turned an unruffled front on Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we'd better chuck those fellows&mdash;fire 'em out bodily, the
      impudent cusses! What do you say, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dan was too demoralized to consider or even reply to this. He was
      feeling a burning sense of shame and disgrace. The whole town must know
      his father's history, or some garbled version of it. Worse still,
      Constance Emory must know. The pride of his respectability was gone from
      him. He felt that he had cheated the world of a place to which he had no
      right, and now he was found out. He could not face Kerr, nor Holt, nor
      McClintock. But this was only temporary. He couldn't stand among his
      ruins. Men survive disgrace and outlive shame just as they outlive sorrow
      and suffering. Nothing ever stops. Then he recognized that, since his
      secret had been wrested from him, there was no longer discovery to fear. A
      sense of freedom and relief came when he realized this. The worst had
      happened, and he could still go on. How the men had learned about his
      father he could not understand, but instinct told him he had Ryder to
      thank. Following up the clew Kenyon had given him, he had carefully looked
      into Roger Oakley's record, a matter that simply involved a little
      correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had told Branyon and Stokes only what he saw fit, and had pledged
      himself to support the men in whatever action they took. He would drive
      Oakley out of Antioch. That was one of his motives; he was also bent on
      cultivating as great a measure of personal popularity as he could. It
      would be useful to Kenyon, and so advantageous to himself. The Congressman
      had large ambitions. If he brought his campaign to a successful issue it
      would make him a power in the State. Counting in this victory, Ryder had
      mapped out his own career. Kenyon had force and courage, but his judgment
      and tact were only of a sort. Ryder aspired to supply the necessary brains
      for his complete success. Needless to say, Kenyon knew nothing of these
      benevolent intentions on the part of his friend. He could not possibly
      have believed that he required anything but votes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley turned to Clarence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run into the carpenter-shop, and see if you can find my father. If he is
      there, ask him to come here to me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy was absent only a few moments. Roger Oakley had taken off his work
      clothes and had gone up-town before the men left the shop. He had not
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan closed his desk and put on his hat, &ldquo;I am going to the hotel,&rdquo; he said
      to Kerr. &ldquo;If anybody wants to see me you can tell them I'll be back this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Oakley.&rdquo; The treasurer was wondering what would be his
      superior's action. Would he resign and leave Antioch, or would he try and
      stick it out?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he left the room, Dan said to McClintock:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won't have any further trouble, Milt Better keep an eye on
      that fellow Branyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McClintock laughed shortly, but made no answer, and for the rest of the
      morning Clarence dogged his steps in the hope that the quarrel would be
      continued under more favorable circumstances. In this he was disappointed.
      Branyon had been induced to go home for repairs, and had left the yards
      immediately after the trouble occurred, with a wet handkerchief held
      gingerly to a mashed and bloody nose. His fellows had not shown the
      sympathy he felt they should have shown under the circumstances. They told
      him he had had enough, and that it was well to stop with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan hurried up-town to the hotel. He found his father in his room, seated
      before an open window in his shirt-sleeves, and with his Bible in his lap.
      He glanced up from the book as his son pushed open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dannie?&rdquo; he said, and his tones were mild, meditative, and
      inquiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking for you, father. They told me you'd come up-town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did; as soon as I heard there was going to be trouble over my
      working in the shops I left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they say anything to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word, Dannie, but I knew what was coming, and quit work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn't have done it, daddy,&rdquo; said Dan, seating himself on the edge
      of the bed near the old man. &ldquo;I can't let them say who shall work in the
      shops and who not. The whole business was trumped up out of revenge for
      the cut. They want to get even with me for <i>that</i>, you see. If I back
      down and yield this point, there is no telling what they'll ask next&mdash;probably
      that the wages be restored to the old figure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke quite cheerfully, for he saw his father was cruelly hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all a mistake, Dannie&mdash;my coming to you, I mean,&rdquo; Roger
      Oakley said, shutting the book reverently and laying it to one side. &ldquo;The
      world's a small place, after all, and we should have known we couldn't
      keep our secret. It's right I should bear my own cross, but it's not your
      sin, and now it presses hardest on you. I'm sorry, Dannie&mdash;&rdquo; and his
      voice shook with the emotion he was striving to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, father. To have you here has been a great happiness to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it, Dannie? has it really?&rdquo; with a quick smile. &ldquo;I am glad you can
      say so, for it's been a great happiness to me&mdash;greater than I
      deserved,&rdquo; and he laid a big hand caressingly on his son's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go ahead, daddy, as if nothing had happened. If we let this hurt
      us, we'll end by losing all our courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been a knock-out blow for me, Dannie,&rdquo; with a wistful sadness, &ldquo;and
      I've got to go away. It's best for you I should. I've gone in one
      direction and you've gone another. You can't reconcile opposites. I've
      been thinking of this a good deal. You're young, and got your life ahead
      of you, and you'll do big things before you're done, and people will
      forget I can't drag you down just because I happen to be your father and
      love you. Why, I'm of a different class even, but I can't go on. I'm just
      as I am, and I can't change myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, bless your heart, daddy,&rdquo; cried Dan, &ldquo;I wouldn't have you changed.
      You're talking nonsense. I won't let you go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the girl, Dannie, the girl&mdash;the doctor's daughter! You see I
      hear a lot of gossip in the shop, and even if you haven't told me, I
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may as well count that at an end,&rdquo; said Dan, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think of leaving here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. If I began by running, I'd be running all the rest of my life. I
      shall remain until I've accomplished everything I've set out to do, if it
      takes ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about Miss Emory, Dannie? If you are going to stay, why is that
      at an end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say she'll marry Mr. Ryder. Anyhow, she won't marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you cared for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you give up? You're as good as he is any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not her kind, that's all. It has nothing to do with this. It would
      have been the same, anyhow. I'm not her kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley turned this over slowly in his mind. It was most astonishing.
      He couldn't grasp it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean she thinks she is better than you are?&rdquo; he asked, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of that sort, I suppose,&rdquo; dryly. &ldquo;I want you to come back into
      the shops, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't do it, Dannie. I'm sorry if you wish it, but it's impossible. I
      want to keep out of sight. Back East, when they pardoned me, every one
      knew, and I didn't seem to mind, but here it's not the same. I can't face
      it. It may be cowardly, but I can't.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>AKLEY had told his
      father he was going to call at the Emorys'. He wanted to see Constance
      once more. Then it didn't much matter what happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed up the street he was conscious of an impudent curiosity in
      the covert glances the idlers on the corners shot at him. With hardly an
      exception they turned to gaze after him as he strode by. He realized that
      an unsavory distinction had been thrust upon him. He had become a marked
      man. He set his lips in a grim smile. This was what he would have to meet
      until the silly wonder of it wore off, or a fresh sensation took its
      place, and there would be the men at the shops; their intercourse had
      hitherto been rather pleasant and personal, as he had recognized certain
      responsibilities in the relation which had made him desire to be more than
      a mere task-master. The thought of his theories caused him to smile again.
      His humanitarian-ism had received a jolt from which it would not recover
      in many a long day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands already hated him as a tyrant, and probably argued that his
      authority was impaired by the events of the morning, though how they
      arrived at any such conclusion was beyond him, but he had felt something
      of the kind in Branyon's manner. When the opportunity came it would be a
      satisfaction to undeceive them, and he was not above wishing this
      opportunity might come soon, for his mood was bitter and revengeful, when
      he recalled their ignorant and needlessly brutal insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early as he was, he found, as he had anticipated when he started out, that
      Ryder was ahead of him. The editor was lounging on the Emorys' porch with
      the family. He had dined with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Dan approached he caught the sound of Constance's voice. There was no
      other voice in Antioch which sounded the same, or possessed the same
      quality of refinement and culture. His heart beat with quickened
      pulsations and his pace slackened. He paused for an instant in the shadow
      of the lilac-bushes that shut off the well-kept lawn from the street. Then
      he forced himself to go on. There was no gain in deferring his sentence;
      better have it over with. Yet when he reached the gate he would gladly
      have passed it without entering had it not been that he never abandoned
      any project simply because it was disagreeable. He had done too many
      disagreeable things not to have outlived this species of cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant he saw him, the doctor rose from his seat on the steps and
      came quickly down the walk. There was no mistaking the cordiality he gave
      his greeting, for he intended there should be none. Mrs. Emory, too, took
      pains that he should feel the friendliness of her sentiment towards him.
      Constance, however, appeared embarrassed and ill at ease, and Dan's face
      grew very white. He felt that he had no real appreciation of the changed
      conditions since his father's story had become public property. He saw it
      made a difference in the way his friends viewed him. He had become
      hardened, and it had been impossible for him to foresee just how it would
      affect others, but to these people it was plainly a shock. The very
      kindliness he had experienced at the hands of the doctor and Mrs. Emory
      only served to show how great the shock was. In their gracious, generous
      fashion they had sought to make it easy for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley and the editor did not speak. Civility seemed the rankest hypocrisy
      under the circumstances. A barely perceptible inclination of the head
      sufficed, and then Ryder turned abruptly to Miss Emory and resumed his
      conversation with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan seated himself beside the doctor on the steps. He was completely
      crushed. He hadn't the wit to leave, and he knew that he was a fool for
      staying. What was the good in carrying on the up-hill fight any longer?
      Courage is a fine quality, no doubt, but it is also well for a man to have
      sense enough to know when he is fairly beaten, and he was fairly beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took stock of the situation. Quite independent of his hatred of the
      fellow, he resented Ryder's presence there beside Constance. But what was
      the use of struggling? The sooner he banished all thought of her the
      better it would be for him. His chances had never been worth considering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole a glance at the pair, who had drawn a little to one side, and
      were talking in low tones and with the intimacy of long acquaintance. He
      owned they were wonderfully well suited to each other. Ryder was no mean
      rival, had it come to that. The world had given him its rub. He knew
      perfectly the life with which Miss Emory was familiar, his people had been
      the right sort. He was well-born and well-bred, and he showed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It dawned upon the unwilling Oakley slowly and by degrees that to
      Constance Emory he must be nothing more nor less than the son of a
      murderer. He had never quite looked at it in that light before. He had
      been occupied with the effect rather than the cause, but he was sure that
      if Ryder had told her his father's history he had made the most of his
      opportunity. He wondered how people felt about a thing of this kind. He
      knew now what his portion would be. Disgrace is always vicarious in its
      consequences. The innocent generally suffer indiscriminately along with
      the guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor talked a steady stream at Oakley, but he managed to say little
      that made any demand on Dan's attention. He was sorry for the young man.
      He had liked him from the start, and he believed but a small part of what
      he had heard. It is true he had had the particulars from Ryder, but Ryder
      said what he had to say with his usual lazy indifference, as if his
      interest was the slightest, and had vouched for no part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would hardly have dared admit that he himself was the head and front of
      the offending. Dr. Emory would not have understood how it could have been
      any business of his. It would have finished him with the latter. As it was
      he had been quick to resent his glib, sneering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dan's manner convinced the doctor that there were some grounds for the
      charges made by the hands when they demanded Roger Oakley's dismissal, or
      else he was terribly hurt by the occurrence. While Dr. Emory was reaching
      this conclusion Dan was cursing himself for his stupidity. It would have
      been much wiser for him to have remained away until Antioch quieted down.
      Perhaps it would have been fairer, too, to his friends, but since he had
      blundered he would try and see Miss Emory again; she should know the
      truth. It was characteristic of him that he should wish the matter put
      straight, even when there was no especial advantage to be gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards he took his leave. The doctor followed him down to the
      gate. There was a certain constraint in the manner of the two men, now
      that they were alone together. As they paused by the gate, Dr. Emory broke
      silence with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, Oakley, what is this I hear about your father? I'd like
      your assurance that it is all a pack of lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A lump came into Dan's throat, and he answered, huskily: &ldquo;I am sure it is
      not at all as you have heard; I am sure the facts are quite different from
      the account you have had&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't deny it outright, much as I'd like to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean&mdash;Pardon me, for, of course, I have no right to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan turned away his face. &ldquo;I don't know any one who has a better right to
      ask,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shouldn't have asked if I'd thought there was a word of truth in
      the story. I had hoped I could deny it for you. That was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I didn't appreciate how you would view it. I have lived in the
      shadow of it so long&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked aghast at the admission. He had not understood before
      that Dan was acknowledging the murder. Even yet he could not bring himself
      to believe it. Dan moved off a step, as if to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean it is true, Oakley?&rdquo; he asked, detaining him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Substantially, yes. Good-night,&rdquo; he added, hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; hastily. &ldquo;I don't want you to go just yet.&rdquo; He put out his hand
      frankly. &ldquo;It's nothing you have done, anyhow,&rdquo; he said, as an
      afterthought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I begin to think it might just as well have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Emory regarded him earnestly. &ldquo;My boy, I'm awfully sorry for you, and
      I'm afraid you have gotten in for more than you can manage. It looks as
      though your troubles were all coming in a bunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan smiled. &ldquo;My antecedents won't affect the situation down at the shops,
      if that is what you mean. The men may not like me any the better, or
      respect me any the more for knowing of them, but they will discover that
      that will make no difference where our relations are concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. I only meant that public opinion will be pretty strong
      against you. It somehow has an influence,&rdquo; ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it has,&rdquo; rather sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you have to stay and face it? It might be easier, you know&mdash;I
      don't mean exactly to run away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pledged to put the shops and road on a paying basis for General
      Cornish. He'd about made up his mind to sell to the M. &amp; W. If he
      does, it will mean the closing of the shops, and they will never be opened
      up again. That will wipe Antioch off the map. Not so very long ago I had a
      good deal of sympathy for the people who would be ruined, and I can't
      change simply because they have, can I?&rdquo; with a look on his face which
      belonged to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor stroked his beard meditatively and considered the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there is such a thing as duty, but don't you think, under the
      circumstances, your responsibility is really very light?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't imagine you would be the first to advise me to shirk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't ordinarily, but you don't know Antioch. They can make it very
      unpleasant for you. The town is in a fever of excitement over what has
      happened to-day. It seems the men are not through with you yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. My father should have gone back. It looks as if I'd yielded,
      but I couldn't ask him to when I saw how he felt about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see the town lives off the shops and road. It is a personal matter to
      every man, woman, and child in the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what makes me so mad at the stupid fools!&rdquo; said Oakley, with some
      bitterness. &ldquo;They haven't the brains to see that they have a lot more at
      stake than any one else. If they could gain anything from a fight I'd have
      plenty of patience with them, but they are sure losers. Even if they
      strike, and the shops are closed for the next six months, it won't cost
      Cornish a dollar; indeed, it will be money in his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think they'll strike,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I didn't mean that
      exactly, but they'll try to keep you on a strain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have done about all they can in that direction. The worst has
      happened. I won't say it didn't bruise me up a bit. Why, I am actually
      sore in every bone and muscle. I was never so battered, but I'm beginning
      to get back, and I'm going to live the whole thing down right here. I
      can't have skeletons that are liable to be unearthed at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a letter from his pocket, opened it and handed it to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you can see to read this if you will step nearer the
      street-lamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter was an offer from one of the big Eastern lines. While the
      doctor knew very little of railroads, he understood that the offer was a
      fine one, and was impressed accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd take it.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wouldn't fritter away my time here. Precious
      little thanks you'll ever get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't honorably break with General Cornish. In fact, I have already
      declined, but I wanted you to see the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for your sake that you did. You are sure to have more
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the more reason why I should stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite frank with you, Oakley. Some strong influence is at work. No,
      it hasn't to do with your father. You can't well be held accountable for
      his acts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder's laughter reached them as he spoke. Oakley could see him faintly
      outlined in the moonlight, where he sat between Constance Emory and her
      mother. The influence was there. It was probably at work at that very
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be made a martyr through any chivalrous sense of duty,&rdquo;
       continued the doctor. &ldquo;I'd look out for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan laughed again. &ldquo;You are preaching cowardice at a great rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what's the use of sacrificing one's self? You possess a most
      horrible sense of rectitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to ask a favor of you,&rdquo; hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to say if there was anything I could do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't mind,&rdquo; with increasing hesitancy, &ldquo;will you say to Miss
      Emory for me that I'd like to see her to-morrow afternoon? I'll call about
      three&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'll tell her for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; gratefully. &ldquo;Thank you very much. You think she will be at
      home?&rdquo; awkwardly, for he was afraid the doctor had misunderstood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy so. I can see now, if you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't. I'll call on the chance of finding her in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you prefer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley extended his hand. &ldquo;I won't keep you standing any longer. Somehow
      our talk has helped me. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gazed abstractedly after the young man as he moved down the
      street, and he continued to gaze after him until he had passed from sight
      in the shadows that lay beneath the whispering maples.

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ERHAPS it showed
      lack of proper feeling, but Oakley managed to sleep off a good deal of his
      emotional stress, and when he left his hotel the next morning he was quite
      himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His attitude towards the world was the decently cheerful one of the man
      who is earning a good salary, and whose personal cares are fax from being
      numerous or pressing. He was still capable of looking out for Cornish's
      interests, and his own, too, if the need arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down to the office alert and vigorous. As he strode along he
      nodded and smiled at the people he met on the street. If the odium of his
      father's crime was to attach itself to him it should be without his help.
      Antioch might count him callous if it liked, but it must not think him
      weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first official act was to go for Kerr, who was unusually cantankerous,
      and he gave that frigid gentleman a scare which lasted him for the better
      part of a week. For Kerr, who had convinced himself overnight that Oakley
      must resign, saw himself having full swing with the Huckleberry, and was
      disposed to treat his superior with airy indifference. He had objected to
      hunting up an old order-book Dan wished to see, on the score that he was
      too busy, whereat, as Holt expressed it, the latter &ldquo;jumped on him with
      both feet.&rdquo; His second official act was to serve formal notice on Branyon
      that he was dismissed from the shops, the master-mechanic's dismissal not
      having been accepted as final, for Branyon had turned up that morning with
      a black eye as if to go to work. He was even harsh with Miss Walton, and
      took exception to her spelling of a typewritten letter, which he was
      sending off to Cornish in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also inspected every department in the shops, and was glad of an excuse
      he discovered to reprimand Joe Stokes, who was stock-keeper in the
      carpenter's room, for the slovenly manner in which the stock was handled.
      Then he returned to the office, and as a matter of discipline kept Kerr
      busy all the rest of the morning hauling dusty order-books from a dark
      closet. He felt that if excitement was what was wanted he was the one to
      furnish it. He had been too easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He even read Clarence, whom he had long since given up as hopeless, a
      moving lecture on the sin of idleness, and that astonished youth, who had
      fancied himself proof against criticism, actually searched for things to
      do, so impressed and startled was he by the manager's earnestness, and so
      fearful was he lest he should lose his place. If that happened, he knew
      his father would send him to school, and he almost preferred work, so he
      flew around, was under everybody's feet and in everybody's way, and when
      Oakley left the office at half-past two, Holt forcibly ejected him, after
      telling him he was a first-class nuisance, and that if he Stuck his nose
      inside the door again he'd skin him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling deeply his unpopularity, Clarence withdrew to the yards, where he
      sought out Dutch Pete With tears in his eyes he begged the yard boss to
      find some task for him, it made no difference what, just so it was work;
      but Dutch Pete didn't want to be bothered, and sent him away with what
      Clarence felt to be a superfluity of bad words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally the office force gave a deep sigh of satisfaction when Oakley
      closed his desk and announced that he was going up-town and would not
      return. Miss Walton confided to Kerr that she just hoped he would never
      come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a little before three o'clock when Dan presented himself at the
      Emorys'. The maid who answered his ring ushered him into the parlor with
      marked trepidation. She was a timid soul. Then she swished from the room,
      but returned almost immediately to say that Miss Emory would be down in a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what's troubling her,&rdquo; muttered Oakley, with some exasperation.
      &ldquo;You'd think she expected me to take her head off.&rdquo; He guessed that, like
      her betters, she was enjoying to the limit the sensation of which he was
      the innocent victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Constance entered the room, he advanced a little uncertainly. She
      extended her hand quite cordially, however. There was no trace of
      embarrassment or constraint in her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he took her hand, Dan said, simply, going straight to the purpose of
      his call: &ldquo;I have thought a good deal over what I want to tell you, Miss
      Emory.&rdquo; Miss Emory instantly took the alarm, and was on the defensive. She
      enveloped herself in that species of inscrutable feminine reserve men find
      so difficult to penetrate. She could not imagine what he had to tell her
      that was so pressing. He was certainly very curious and unconventional.
      There was one thing she feared he might want to tell her which she was
      firmly determined not to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley drew forward a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo; he asked, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, yes.&rdquo; It was all so formal they both smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan stood with his back to the fire-place, now filled with ferns, and
      rested an elbow on the mantel. There was an awkward pause. At last he
      said, slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems I've been the subject of a lot of talk during the last two days,
      and I have been saddled with a matter for which I am in no way
      responsible, though it appears to reflect on me quite as much as if I
      were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Oakley&rdquo;&mdash;began Constance, scenting danger ahead. But her
      visitor was in no mood to temporize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, please,&rdquo; he said, hastily. &ldquo;You have heard the story from Mr.
      Ryder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard it from others as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has influenced you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't say that,&rdquo; defiantly. She was not accustomed to being
      catechised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least it has caused you to seriously doubt the wisdom of an
      acquaintance,&rdquo; blurted Oakley. &ldquo;You are very unfair,&rdquo; rising with latent
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will greatly oblige me by sitting down again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Constance, astonished beyond measure at his tone of command, sank back
      into her chair with a little smothered gasp of surprise. No one had ever
      ventured to speak to her like that before. It was a new experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to finish this, you know,&rdquo; explained Dan, with one of his
      frankest smiles, and there was a genial simplicity about his smile which
      was very attractive. Constance, however, was not to be propitiated, but
      she kept her seat. She was apprehensive lest Oakley would do something
      more startling and novel if she attempted to cut short the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stole a glance at him from under her long lashes. He was studying the
      carpet, apparently quite lost to the enormity of his conduct. &ldquo;You have
      heard their side of the story, Miss Emory. I want you to hear mine. It's
      only fair, isn't it? You have heard that my father is an ex-convict?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a tinge of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is a murderer?&rdquo; plunging ahead mercilessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is influencing you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is,&rdquo; helplessly. &ldquo;It would naturally. It was a great shock
      to us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Dan, &ldquo;I can understand, I think, just how you must look at
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very, very sorry for you, Mr. Oakley. I want to explain my manner
      last night. The whole situation was so excessively awkward. I am sure you
      must have felt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, I hope you didn't think me unkind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then he added, a trifle wearily, &ldquo;It's taken me all this time to
      realize my position. I suppose I owe you some sort of an apology. You must
      have thought me fearfully thick-skinned.&rdquo; He hoped she would say no, but
      he was disappointed. Her conscience had been troubling her, and she was
      perfectly willing to share her remorse with him, since he was so ready to
      assume a part of it. She was as conventional as extreme respectability
      could make her, but she had never liked Oakley half so well. She admired
      his courage. He didn't whine. His very stupidity was in its way admirable,
      but it was certainly too bad he could not see just how impossible he was
      under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan raised his eyes to hers. &ldquo;Miss Emory, the only time I remember to have
      seen my father until he came here a few weeks ago was through the grating
      of his cell door. My mother took me there as a little boy. When she died I
      came West, where no one knew me. I had already learned that, because of
      him, I was somehow judged and condemned, too. It has always been hanging
      over me. I have always feared exposure. I suppose I can hush it up after a
      while, but there will always be some one to tell it to whoever will
      listen. It is no longer a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it fair to your friends, Mr. Oakley, that it was a secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see what business it was of theirs. It's nothing I have done,
      and, anyhow, I have never had any friends until now I cared especially
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and Miss Emory lowered her eyes. So long as he was merely determined
      and stupid he was safe, but should he become sentimental it might be
      embarrassing for them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen my father. Do you think from what you can judge from
      appearances that he would kill a man in cold blood? It was only after
      years of insult that it came to that, and then the other man was the
      aggressor. What my father did he did in self-defence, but I am pretty sure
      you were not told this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was swayed by a sense of duty towards his father, and a desire to
      vindicate him&mdash;he was so passive and enduring. The intimacy of their
      relation had begotten warmth and sympathy. They had been drawn nearer and
      nearer each other. The clannishness of his blood and race asserted itself.
      It was a point of honor with him to stand up for his friends, and to stand
      up for his father most of all. Could he, he would have ground his heel
      into Ryder's face for his part in circulating the garbled version of the
      old convict's history. Some one should suffer as he had been made to
      suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Mr. Ryder did not know what you have told me,&rdquo; Constance said,
      hastily. She could not have told why, but she had the uneasy feeling that
      Griff required a champion, that he was responsible. &ldquo;Then you did hear it
      from Mr. Ryder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, and Oakley, taking her silence for assent, continued:
      &ldquo;I don't suppose it was told you either that he was pardoned because of an
      act of conspicuous heroism, that, at the risk of his own life, he saved
      the lives of several nurses and patients in the hospital ward of the
      prison where he was confined.&rdquo; He looked inquiringly at Constance, but she
      was still silent. &ldquo;Miss Emory, my father came to me to all intents an
      absolute stranger. Why, I even feared him, for I didn't know the kind of
      man he was, but I have come to have a great affection and regard for him.
      I respect him, too, most thoroughly. There is not an hour of the day when
      the remembrance of his crime is not with him. Don't you think it cowardly
      that it should have been ventilated simply to hurt me, when it must
      inevitably hurt him so much more? He has quit work in the shops, and he is
      determined to leave Antioch. I may find him gone when I return to the
      hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you blame Mr. Ryder for this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. It's part of the debt we'll settle some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are unjust. It was Mr. Kenyon. His cousin is warden of the
      prison. He saw your father there and remembered him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And told Mr. Ryder,&rdquo; with a contemptuous twist of the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were others present at the time. They were not alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Ryder furnished the men with the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; And once more her tone was one of defiance and defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been told so, and I have every reason to believe I was correctly
      informed. Why, don't you admit that it was a cowardly piece of business to
      strike at me over my father's shoulder?&rdquo; demanded Oakley, with palpable
      exasperation. The narrowness of her nature and her evasions galled him.
      Why didn't she show a little generous feeling. He expected she would be
      angry at his words and manner. On the contrary, she replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not defending Mr. Ryder, as you seem to think, but I do not believe
      in condemning any one as you would condemn him&mdash;unheard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was unduly conscious, perhaps, that sound morality was on her side in
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us leave him out of it. After all, it is no odds who told. The harm
      is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shall ask Griff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan smiled, doubtfully. &ldquo;That will settle it, if you believe what he tells
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His denial will be quite sufficient for me, Mr. Oakley,&rdquo; with chilly
      politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, during which Dan looked at the carpet, and Miss
      Emory at nothing in particular. He realized how completely he had
      separated himself from the rest of the world in her eyes. The hopelessness
      of his love goaded him on. He turned to her with sudden gentleness and
      said, penitently: &ldquo;Won't you forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to forgive, Mr. Oakley,&rdquo; with lofty self-denial, and again
      Dan smiled doubtfully. Her saying so did not mean all it should have meant
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swept his hand across his face with a troubled gesture. &ldquo;I don't know
      what to do,&rdquo; he observed, ruefully. &ldquo;The turf seems knocked from under my
      feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been a dreadful ordeal to pass through alone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We
      are so distressed for your sake.&rdquo; And she seemed so keenly sympathetic
      that Dan's heart gave a great bound in his breast. He put aside his
      mounting bitterness against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why I came to see you to-day. I just wanted to, and so I
      came. I don't want to force a friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Emory murmured that no excuse was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not too sure of that. I must appear bent on exhibiting myself and my
      woes, but I can't go into retirement, and I can't let people see I'm
      hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face took on a strong resolve. He couldn't go without telling her he
      loved her. His courage was suddenly riotous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, not long ago, I dared to believe I might level the differences
      between us. I recognized what they were, but now it is hopeless. There are
      some things a man can't overcome, no matter how hard he tries, and I
      suppose being the son of a murderer is one of these.&rdquo; He paused, and,
      raising his eyes from the carpet, glanced at her, but her face was
      averted. He went on, desperately: &ldquo;It's quite hopeless, but I have dared
      to hope, and I wanted you to know. I hate to leave things unfinished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, then Miss Emory said, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means you've never cared for me,&rdquo; dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not answer him. She was wondering how she would have felt had
      the confession come forty-eight hours earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I've been quite weak and foolish,&rdquo; said Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked into his face with a slow smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that? Is it weak and foolish to care for some one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't it?&rdquo; with suddenly kindled hope, for he found it hard to give her
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Emory drew herself together with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought of this,&rdquo; she said, which was hardly true; she had
      thought of it many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Dan, innocently enough, for her lightest word had become
      gospel to him, such was his love and reverence. &ldquo;You couldn't know.&rdquo; Poor
      Oakley, his telling of it was the smallest part of the knowledge. &ldquo;I think
      I see now, perfectly, how great a difference this affair of my father's
      must make. It sort of cuts me off from everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very tragic. I wish you hadn't told me just now.&rdquo; Her lips trembled
      pathetically, and there were tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've wanted to tell you for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you couldn't know,&rdquo; he repeated; then he plunged ahead
      recklessly, for he found there was a curious satisfaction in telling her
      of his love, hopeless as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been most serious and sacred to me. I shall never forget you&mdash;never.
      It has helped me in so many ways just to know you. It has changed so many
      of my ideals. I can't be grateful enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Emory approved his attitude. It was as it should be. She was sorry
      for him. She admired his dignity and repression. It made him seem so
      strong and purposeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find your happiness some day, Mr. Oakley. You will find some one
      more worthy than I.&rdquo; She knew he would be insensible to the triteness of
      her remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; generously, &ldquo;that couldn't be. I'll not find any one. I'll not
      look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already, with the selfishness of her sex, and a selfishness which was
      greater than that of her sex, she was regretting that she had allowed him
      to step so easily into the position of a rejected lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want you to think it is going to ruin my life,&rdquo; he said, quietly,
      &ldquo;or anything of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An appeal to her pity seemed weak and contemptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have striven to win what I can't have, what is not for me, and I am
      satisfied to have made the effort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Emory bit her lip. He was going to put her out of his life entirely.
      It was ended, and he would do his best to forget her with what speed he
      might, for he loved her, and was too generous to wish her to suffer. This
      generosity, needless to say, was too altruistic for Constance to fully
      appreciate its beauties. Indeed, she did not regard it as generosity at
      all. She resented it. She realized that probably she would not see him
      again; at least the meeting would not be of his making or choosing. There
      was to be no sentimental aftermath. He was preparing to go, like the
      sensible fellow he was, for good and all, and she rebelled against the
      decree. It seemed brutal and harsh. She was angry, hurt, and offended.
      Perhaps her conscience was troubling her, too. She knew she was mean and
      petty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it could have been very serious to you, Mr. Oakley,&rdquo; she
      murmured, gazing abstractedly from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why you think that. I can't say any more than I have said.
      It includes all.&rdquo; She wanted to tell him he gave up too easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, we are friends,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; she cried, with a ring of real longing and regret in her
      voice, lifted out of herself for the moment at the thought of losing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan nodded, and a look of pain came into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not going to leave Antioch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Miss Emory felt a sense of relief. She rose from her chair. &ldquo;Then I
      shall see you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; smiling. &ldquo;We couldn't well avoid seeing each other in a place
      the size of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I sha'n't see you here any more?&rdquo; she asked, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; a little roughly. The bitterness of his loss stung him. He
      felt something was wrong somewhere. He wondered, too, if she had been
      quite fair to him, if her ability to guard herself was entirely
      commendable, after all. He knew, in the end, his only memory of her would
      be that she was beautiful. He would carry this memory and a haunting sense
      of incompleteness with him wherever he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed her hand in his and looked up into his face with troubled,
      serious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; It was almost a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan crossed the room to the door and flung it open. For an instant he
      wavered on the threshold, but a moment later he was striding down the
      street, with his hat jammed needlessly low over his ears, and his hands
      thrust deep in his trousers pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the window, Constance, with a white, scared face, was watching him from
      between the parted curtains. She hoped he would look back, but he never
      once turned his head.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N Thursday the <i>Herald</i>
      published its report of the trouble at the shops. Oakley had looked
      forward to the paper's appearance with considerable eagerness. He hoped to
      glean from it some idea of the tactics the men would adopt, and in this he
      was not disappointed. Ryder served up his sensation, which was still a
      sensation, in spite of the fact that it was common property and two days
      old before it was accorded the dignity of type and ink, in his most
      impressive style:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The situation at the car-shops has assumed a serious phase, and a strike
      is imminent. Matters came to a focus day before yesterday, and may now be
      said to have reached an acute stage. It is expected that the carpenters&mdash;of
      whom quite a number are employed on repair work&mdash;will be the first to
      go out unless certain demands which they are to make to-day are promptly
      acceded to by General Cornish's local representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both sides maintain the strictest secrecy, but from reliable sources the
      Herald gathers that the men will insist upon Mr. Branyon being taken back
      by the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another grievance of the men, and one in which they should have the
      sympathy of the entire community, is their objection to working with the
      manager's father, who came here recently from the East and has since been
      employed in the shops. It has been learned that he is an ex-convict who
      was sentenced for a long term of imprisonment in June, 1875, for the
      murder of Thomas Sharp, at Burton, Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was only recently set at liberty, and the men are natural-ly incensed
      and indignant at having to work with him. Still another grievance is the
      new schedule of wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A committee representing every department in the shops and possessing the
      fullest authority, met last night at the Odd Fellows' Hall on South Main
      Street, but their deliberations were secret. A well-authenticated rumor
      has it, however, that the most complete harmony prevailed, and that the
      employés are pledged to drastic measures unless they get fair treatment
      from the company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder tacked a moral to this, and the moral was that labor required a
      champion to protect it from the soulless greed and grinding tyranny of the
      great corporations which had sprung into existence under the fostering
      wing of corrupt legislation. Of course &ldquo;the Picturesque Statesman from Old
      Hanover&rdquo; was the Hercules who was prepared to right these wrongs of honest
      industry, and to curb the power of Cornish, whose vampire lusts fattened
      on the sweat of the toiler, and especially the toiler at Antioch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A copy of the paper was evidently sent the &ldquo;Picturesque Statesman,&rdquo; who
      had just commenced his canvass, for in its very next issue the <i>Herald</i>
      was able to print a telegram in which he &ldquo;heartily endorsed the sentiments
      embodied in the <i>Herald's</i> ringing editorial on the situation at
      Antioch,&rdquo; and declared himself a unit with his fellow-citizens of whatever
      party in their heroic struggle for a fair day's wage for a fair day's
      work. He also expressed himself as honored by their confidence, as,
      indeed, he might well have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan digested the <i>Herald's</i> report along with his breakfast. Half an
      hour later, when he reached the office, he found McClintock waiting for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men want to see you, Mr. Oakley. They were going to send their
      committee in here, but I told 'em you'd come out to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. It's just as well you did.&rdquo; And Oakley followed him from the
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you read the <i>Herald's</i> yap this morning?&rdquo; Inquired the
      master-mechanic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dan, &ldquo;I did. It was rather funny, Wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The town will be owing Ryder a coat of tar and feathers presently. He'll
      make these fools think they've got a reason to be sore on the company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men were clustered about the great open door of the works in their
      shirt-sleeves. From behind them, in the silence and the shadow, came the
      pleasant, droning sound of machinery, like the humming of a million bees.
      There was something dogged and reckless in the very way they stood around,
      with folded arms, or slouched nervously to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan singled out Bentick and Joe Stokes, and three or four others, as the
      committee, and made straight towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, men, what do you want?&rdquo; he asked, briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We represent every department in the shops, sir,&rdquo; said Bentick, civilly,
      &ldquo;and we consider Branyon's discharge as unjust. We want him taken back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose I won't take him back, what are you going to do about it&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
       asked Dan, good-naturedly, and, not waiting for a reply, with oldtime
      deftness he swung himself up into an empty flat-car which stood close at
      hand and faced his assembled workmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why Branyon was dismissed. It was a business none of you have
      much reason to be proud of, but I am willing to let him come back on
      condition he first offers an apology to McClintock and to me. Unless he
      does he can never set his foot inside these doors again while I remain
      here. I agree to this, because I don't wish to make him a scapegoat for
      the rest of you, and I don't wish those dependent on him to suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He avoided looking in McClintock's direction. He felt, rather than saw,
      that the latter was shaking his head in strong disapproval of his course.
      The committee and the men exchanged grins. The boss was weakening. They
      had scored twice. First against Roger Oakley, and now for Branyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess Branyon would as lief be excused from making an apology, if it's
      all the same to Milt,&rdquo; said Bentick, less civilly than before, and there
      was a ripple of smothered laughter from the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan set his lips, and said, sternly but quietly, '&ldquo;That's for him to
      decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll tell him what you say, and if he's ready to eat humble-pie
      there won't be no kick coming from us,&rdquo; remarked Bentick, impartially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this all?&rdquo; asked Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we can't see the cut.&rdquo; And a murmur of approval came from the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan looked out over the crowd. Why couldn't they see that the final
      victory was in his hands? &ldquo;Be guided by me,&rdquo; he said, earnestly, &ldquo;and take
      my word for it; the cut is necessary. I'll meet you half-way in the
      Branyon matter; let it go at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want our old wages,&rdquo; insisted Bentick, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is out of the question; the shops are running behind; they are not
      earning any money, they never have, and it's as much to your interests as
      mine, or General Cornish's, to do your full part in making them
      profitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pleaded with unmistakable sincerity in his tones, and now he looked at
      McClintock, who nodded his head. This was the stiff talk he liked to hear,
      and had expected from Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The committee turned to the men, and the men sullenly shook their heads.
      Some one whispered, &ldquo;He'll knuckle. He's got to. We'll make him.&rdquo; Dan
      caught the sense of what was said, if not the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wages can't go back until the business in the shops warrants it. If you
      will continue to work under the present arrangement, good and well. If
      not, I see no way to meet your demands. You will have to strike. That,
      however, is an alternative I trust you will carefully weigh before you
      commit yourselves. Once the shops are closed it will not be policy to open
      them until fall, perhaps not until the first of the year. But if you can
      afford to lie idle all summer, it's your own affair. That's exactly what
      it means if you strike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped down from the car, and would have left them then and there, but
      Bentick stepped in front of him. &ldquo;Can't we talk it over, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to talk over, Bentick. Settle it among yourselves.&rdquo; And
      he marched off up the tracks, with McClintock following in his wake and
      commending the stand he had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first emotion of the men was one of profound and depressing surprise
      at the abruptness with, which Oakley had terminated the interview, and his
      evident willingness to close the shops, a move they had not counted on. It
      dashed their courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll call his bluff,&rdquo; cried Bentick, and the men gave a faint cheer.
      They were not so sure it was a bluff, after all. It looked real enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were those who thought, with a guilty pang, of wives and children at
      home, and no payday&mdash;the fortnightly haven of rest towards which,
      they lived. And there were the customarily reckless, souls, who thirsted
      for excitement at any price, and who were willing to see the trouble to a
      finish. These ruled, as they usually do. Not a man returned to work.
      Instead, they hung about the yards and canvassed the situation. Finally
      the theory was advanced that, if the shops were closed, it would serve to
      bring down Cornish's wrath on Oakley, and probably result in his immediate
      dismissal. This theory found instant favor, and straightway became a
      conviction with the majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length all agreed to strike, and the whistle in the shops was set
      shrieking its dismal protest. The men swarmed into the building, where
      each got together his kit of tools. They were quite jolly now, and laughed
      and jested a good deal. Presently they were streaming off up-town, with
      their coats over their arms, and the strike was on.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unusual stillness fell on the yards and in the shops. The belts, as
      they swept on and on in endless revolutions, cut this stillness with a
      sharp, incisive hiss. The machinery seemed to hammer at it, as if to beat
      out some lasting echo. Then, gradually, the volume of sound lessened. It
      mumbled to a dotage of decreasing force, and then everything stopped with
      a sudden jar. The shops had shut down.
    </p>
    <p>
      McClintock came from the office and entered the works, pulling the big
      doors to after him. He wanted to see that all was made snug. He cursed
      loudly as he strode through the deserted building. It was the first time
      since he had been with the road that the shops had been closed, and it
      affected him strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place held a dreadful, ghostly inertness. The belts and shafting, with
      its innumerable cogs and connections, reached out like the heavy-knuckled
      tentacles of some great, lifeless monster. The sunlight stole through the
      broken, cobwebbed windows, to fall on heaps of rusty iron and heaps of
      dirty shavings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the engine-room he discovered Smith Roberts and his assistant, Joe
      Webber, banking the fires, preparatory to leaving. They were the only men
      about the place. Roberts closed a furnace-door with a bang, threw down his
      shovel, and drew a grimy arm across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see such a lot of lunkheads, Milt? I'll bet they'll be
      kicking themselves good and hard before they get to the wind-up of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McClintock looked with singular affection at the swelling girths of iron
      which held the panting lungs of the monster the men had doomed to silence,
      and swore his most elaborate oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never did, Smith. You'd think they had money to burn the way they
      chucked their job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you suppose I'll get a chance to build steam again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oakley says we won't start up before the first of September.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE first weeks of
      the strike slipped by without excitement. Harvest time came and went. A
      rainless August browned the earth and seared the woods with its heat, but
      nothing happened to vary the dull monotony. The shops, a sepulchre of
      sound, stood silent and empty. General Cornish, in the rôle of the
      avenger, did not appear on the scene, to Oakley's discomfiture and to the
      joy of the men. A sullen sadness rested on the town. The women began to
      develop shrewish tempers and a trying conversational habit, while their
      husbands squandered their rapidly dwindling means in the saloons. There
      was large talk and a variety of threats, but no lawlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously with the inauguration of the strike, Jeffy reappeared
      mysteriously. He hinted darkly at foreign travel under singularly
      favorable auspices, and intimated that he had been sojourning in a
      community where there was always some one to &ldquo;throw a few whiskeys&rdquo; into
      him when his &ldquo;coppers got hot,&rdquo; and where he had &ldquo;fed his face&rdquo; three
      times a day, so bounteous was the charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At intervals a rumor was given currency that Oakley was on the verge of
      starting up with imported labor, and the men, dividing the watches, met
      each train; but only familiar types, such as the casual commercial
      traveller with his grips, the farmer from up or down the line, with his
      inevitable paper parcels, and the stray wayfarer were seen to step from
      the Huckleberry's battered coaches. Finally it dawned upon the men that
      Dan was bent on starving them into submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryder had displayed what, for him, was a most <i>unusual</i> activity.
      Almost every day he held conferences with the leaders of the strike, and
      his personal influence went far towards keeping the men in line. Indeed,
      his part in the whole affair was much more important than was generally
      recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The political campaign had started, and Kenyon was booked to speak in
      Antioch. It was understood in advance that he would declare for the
      strikers, and his coming caused a welcome flutter of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statesman arrived on No. 7, and the reception committee met him at the
      station in two carriages. It included Cap Roberts, the Hon. Jeb Barrows,
      Ryder, Joe Stokes, and Bentick. The two last were an inspiration of the
      editor's, and proved a popular success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brass-band hired for the occasion discoursed patriotic airs, as
      Kenyon, in a long linen duster and a limp, wilted collar, presented
      himself at the door of the smoker. The great man was all blandness and
      suavity&mdash;an oily suavity that oozed and trickled from every pore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd on the platform gave a faint, unenthusiastic cheer as it caught
      sight of him. It had been more interested in staring at Bentick and
      Stokes. They looked so excessively uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kenyon climbed down the steps and shook hands with Mr. Ryder. Then,
      bowing and smiling to the right and left, he crossed the platform, leaning
      on the editor's arm. At the carriages there were more greetings. Stokes
      and Bentick were formally presented, and the Congressman mounted to a
      place beside them, whereat the crowd cheered again, and Stokes and Bentick
      looked, if possible, more miserable than before. They had a sneaking idea
      that a show was being made of them. Ryder took his place in the second
      carriage, with Cap Roberts and the Hon. Jeb Barrows, and the procession
      moved off up-town to the hotel, preceded by the band playing a lively
      two-step out of tune, and followed by a troop of bare-legged urchins.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper the statesman was serenaded by the band, and a little later
      the members of the Young Men's Kenyon Club, attired in cotton-flannel
      uniforms, marched across from the <i>Herald</i> office to escort him to
      the Rink, where he was to speak. He appeared radiant in a Prince Albert
      and a shiny tile, and a <i>boutonnière</i>, this time leaning on the arm
      of Mr. Stokes, to the huge disgust of that worthy mechanic, who did not
      know that a statesman had to lean on somebody's arm. It is hoary
      tradition, and yet it had a certain significance, too, if it were meant to
      indicate that Kenyon couldn't keep straight unless he was propped.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of fitful enthusiasm swept the assembled crowd, and Mr. Stokes's
      youngest son, Samuel, aged six, burst into tears, no one knew why, and was
      led out of the press by an elder brother, who alternately slapped him and
      wiped his nose on his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kenyon, smiling his unwearied, mirthless smile, seated himself in his
      carriage. Mr. Ryder, slightly bored and wholly cynical, followed his
      example. Mr. Stokes and Mr. Bentick, perspiring and abject, and looking
      for all the world like two criminals, dropped dejectedly into the places
      assigned them. Only Cap Roberts and the Hon. Jeb Barrows seemed entirely
      at ease. They were campaign fixtures. The band emitted a
      harmony-destroying crash, while Mr. Jimmy Smith, the drum-major, performed
      sundry bewildering passes with his gilt staff. The Young Men's Kenyon Club
      fell over its own feet into line, and the procession started for the Rink.
      It was a truly inspiring moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the tail of the procession was clear of the curb, it developed
      that Clarence and Spide were marshalling a rival demonstration. Six small
      and exceedingly dirty youngsters, with reeking torches, headed by Clarence
      and his trusty lieutenant, fell gravely in at the rear of the Kenyon Club.
      Clarence was leaning on Spide's arm. Pussy Roberts preceded them, giving a
      highly successful imitation of Mr. Jimmy Smith. He owned the six torches,
      and it was unsafe to suppress him, but the others spoke disparagingly of
      his performance as a side-show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since an early hour of the evening the people had been gathering at the
      Rink. It was also the Opera-House, where, during the winter months, an
      occasional repertory company appeared in &ldquo;East Lynn,&rdquo; the &ldquo;New Magdalen,&rdquo;
       or Tom Robertson's &ldquo;Caste.&rdquo; The place was two-thirds full at a quarter to
      eight, when a fleet courier arrived with the gratifying news that the
      procession was just leaving the square, and that Kenyon was riding with
      his hat off, and in familiar discourse with Stokes and Bentick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently out of the distance drifted the first strains of the band. A
      little later Cap. Roberts and the Hon. Jeb Barrows appeared on the
      make-shift stage from the wings. There was an applausive murmur, for the
      Hon. Jeb was a popular character. It was said of him that he always
      carried a map of the United States in tobacco juice on his shirt front. He
      was bottle-nosed and red faced. No man could truthfully say he had ever
      seen him drunk, nor had any one ever seen him sober. He shunned extremes.
      Next, the band filed into the balcony, and was laboriously sweating its
      way through the national anthem, when Kenyon and Ryder appeared, followed
      by the wretched Stokes and Bentick. A burst of applause shook the house.
      When it subsided, the editor stepped to the front of the stage. With words
      that halted, for the experience was a new one, he introduced the guest of
      the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was generally agreed afterwards that it had been a great privilege to
      hear Kenyon. No one knew exactly what it was all about, but that was a
      minor consideration. The Congressman was well on towards the end of his
      speech, and had reached the local situation, which he was handling in what
      the <i>Herald</i> subsequently described as &ldquo;a masterly fashion, cool,
      logical, and convincing,&rdquo; when Oakley wandered in, and, unobserved, took a
      seat near the door. He glanced about him glumly. There had been a time
      when these people had been, in their way, his friends. Now those nearest
      him even avoided looking in his direction. At last he became conscious
      that some one far down near the stage, and at the other side of the
      building, was nodding and smiling at him. It was Dr. Emory. Mrs. Emory and
      Constance were with him. Dan caught the fine outline of the latter's
      profile. She was smiling an amused smile. It was her first political
      meeting, and she was finding it quite as funny as Ryder had said it would
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan listened idly, hearing only a word now and then. At length a sentence
      roused him. The speaker was advising the men to stand for their rights. He
      rose hastily, and turned to leave; he had heard enough; but some one cried
      out, &ldquo;Here's Oakley,&rdquo; and instantly every one in the place was staring at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenyon took a step nearer the foot-lights. Either he misunderstood or else
      he wished to provoke an argument, for he said, with slippery civility: &ldquo;I
      shall be very pleased to listen to Mr. Oakley's side of the question. This
      is a free country, and I don't deny him or any man the right to express
      his views. The fact that I am unalterably opposed to the power he
      represents is no bar to the expression here of his opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley's face was crimson. He paused irresolutely; he saw the jeer on
      Ryder's lips, and the desire possessed him to tell these people what fools
      they were to listen to the cheap, lungy patriotism of the demagogue on the
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rested a hand on the back of the chair in front of him, and leaned
      forward with an arm extended at the speaker, but his eyes were fixed on
      Miss Emory's face. She was smiling at him encouragingly, he thought,
      bidding him to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is doubtless your opportunity,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I would like to ask
      what earthly interest you have in Antioch beyond the votes it may give
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenyon smiled blandly and turned for one fleeting instant to wink at
      Ryder. &ldquo;And my reply is this: What about the twenty-million-dollar
      specimen of American manhood who is dodging around London on the money
      he's made here in this State&mdash;yes, and in this town? He's gone to
      England to break his way into London society, and, incidentally, to marry
      his daughter to a title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A roar of laughter greeted this sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; retorted Oakley, hotly, &ldquo;but Antioch has been getting its
      share of his money, too. Don't forget that. There's not a store-keeper in
      this audience whose bank account will not show, in hard American dollars,
      what General Cornish does for Antioch when Antioch is willing to let him
      do for it. But, granted that what you have said is true, who can best
      afford to meet the present situation? General Cornish or these men? On
      whom does the hardship fall heavier, on them or on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not the spirit which prevailed at Bunker Hill and Lexington! No,
      thank God! our fathers did not stop to count the cost, and we have our
      battles to-day just as vital to the cause of humanity; and I, for one,
      would rather see the strong arm of labor wither in its socket than submit
      to wrong or injustice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley choked down his disgust and moved towards the door. There was
      applause and one or two cat-calls. Not heeding them, he made his way from
      the building. He had reached the street when a detaining hand was placed
      upon his arm. He turned savagely, but it proved to be only Turner Joyce,
      who stepped to his side, with a cheerful:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Oakley. They seem to be having a very gay time in
      there, don't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been in?&rdquo; demanded Oakley, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, no! I have just been taking a picture home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Oakley, &ldquo;I have just been making a damned fool of myself. I
      hope that is something you are never guilty of, Mr. Joyce?&rdquo; Joyce laughed,
      and tucked his hand through his companion's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't every one do that occasionally?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan shook off his bitterness. Recently he had been seeing a great deal of
      the little artist and his wife, who were about the only friends he or his
      father had left in Antioch. They walked on in silence Joyce was too
      tactful to ask any questions concerning his friend's affairs, so he
      ventured an impersonal criticism on Kenyon, with the modest diffidence of
      a man who knows he is going counter to public sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither Ruth nor I had any curiosity to hear him speak to-night. I heard
      him when he was here last. It may be my bringing up, but I do like things
      that are not altogether rotten, and I'm afraid I count him as sort of
      decayed.&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;I suppose everybody was at the Rink to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The place was packed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It promises to be a lively campaign, I believe, but I take very little
      interest in politics. My own concerns occupy most of my time. Won't you
      come in, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo; for they had reached his gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the little side porch which opened off the kitchen they found Ruth. She
      rose with a pleased air of animation when she saw who was with her
      husband. Oakley had lived up to his reputation as a patron of the arts. He
      had not forgotten, in spite of his anxieties, the promise made Joyce
      months before, and at that very moment, safely bestowed in Mrs. Joyce's
      possession, were two formidable-looking strips of heavy pink paper, which
      guaranteed the passage of the holder to New York and return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope this confounded strike is not going to interfere with you, Mr.
      Joyce,&rdquo; said Oakley, as he seated himself. He had discovered that they
      liked to talk about their own plans and hopes, and the trip East was the
      chief of these. Already he had considered it with them from every
      conceivable point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is aggravating, for, of course, if people haven't money they can't
      very well afford to have pictures painted. But Ruth is managing
      splendidly. I really don't think it will make any special difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am determined Turner shall not miss this opportunity. I think, if it
      wasn't for me, Mr. Oakley, he'd give up most everything he wants to do, or
      has set his heart on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's lucky to have you, then. Most men need looking after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I do,&rdquo; observed the little artist, with commendable meekness. He
      was keenly alive to his own shortcomings. &ldquo;I'd never get any sort of
      prices for my work if she didn't take a hand in the bargaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one has to be mercenary,&rdquo; said Ruth, apologetically. &ldquo;It's all very
      well to go around with your head in the clouds, but it don't pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it don't pay,&rdquo; agreed Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, which a cricket improved to make itself heard
      above the sweep of the night wind through the tree-tops. Then Ruth said:
      &ldquo;I saw Miss Emory to-day. She asked about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Joyce and her husband had taken a passionate interest in Oakley's
      love affair, and divined the utter wreck of his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she? I saw her at the Rink, too, but of course not to speak with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turner Joyce trod gently but encouragingly on his wife's foot. He felt
      that Oakley would be none the worse for a little cheer, and he had
      unbounded faith in his wife's delicacy and tact. She was just the person
      for such a message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seemed&mdash;that is, I gathered from what she said, and it wasn't so
      much what she said as what she didn't say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan laughed outright, and Joyce joined in with a panic-stricken chuckle.
      Ruth was making as bad a botch of the business as he could have made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all sensitive,&rdquo; said Dan, with sudden candor. &ldquo;I have admired
      her immensely; I do still, for the matter of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don't you go there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't, Mrs. Joyce. You know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think she looks at it differently now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley shook his head. &ldquo;No, she doesn't. There's just one way she can look
      at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women are always changing their minds,&rdquo; persisted Ruth. It occurred to
      her that Constance had been at her worst in her relation with Oakley. If
      she cared a scrap for him, why hadn't she stood by him when he needed it
      most? The little artist blinked tenderly at his wife. He was lost in
      admiration at her courage. He would not have dared to give their friend
      this comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation languished. They heard the strains of the band when the
      meeting at the Rink broke up, and the voices of the people on the street,
      and then there was silence again.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE hot days
      dragged on. Dan and his father moved down to the shops. Two cots were
      placed in the pattern-room, where they slept, and where Roger Oakley spent
      most of his time reading his Bible or in brooding over the situation.
      Their meals were brought to them from the hotel. It was not that Dan
      suspected the men of any sinister intentions, but he felt it was just as
      well that they should understand the utter futility of any lawlessness,
      and, besides, his father was much happier in the solitude of the empty
      shops than he could have been elsewhere in Antioch. All day long he
      followed McClintock about, helping with such odd jobs as were necessary to
      keep the machinery in perfect order. He was completely crushed and broken
      in spirit He had aged, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the office Dan saw only Holt and McClintock. Sick of Kerr's presence,
      and exasperated at his evident sympathy for the strikers&mdash;a sympathy
      he was at no pains to conceal&mdash;he had laid him off, a step that was
      tantamount to dismissal. Miss Walton was absent on her vacation, which he
      extended from week to week. It was maddening to him to have her around
      with nothing to do, for he and Holt found it difficult to keep decently
      busy themselves, now the shops had closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holloway, the vice-president of the road, visited Antioch just once during
      the early days of the strike. He approved&mdash;being of an approving
      disposition&mdash;of all Oakley had done, and then went back home to
      Chicago, after telling him not to yield a single point in the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to starve 'em into submission,&rdquo; said this genial soul. &ldquo;There's
      nothing like an empty stomach to sap a man's courage, especially when he's
      got a houseful of hungry, squalling brats. I don't know but what you'd
      better arrange to get in foreigners. Americans are too independent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Oakley was opposed to this. &ldquo;The men will be glad enough to accept the
      new scale of wages a little later, and the lesson won't be wasted on
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, but the question is, do we want 'em? I wish Cornish was
      here. I think he'd advise some radical move. He's all fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley, however, was devoutly thankful that the general was in England,
      where he hoped he would stay. He had no wish to see the men ruined. A
      wholesome lesson would suffice. He was much relieved when the time arrived
      to escort Holloway to his train.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while the <i>Herald</i> continued its attacks, but Dan no longer
      minded them. Nothing Ryder could say could augment his unpopularity. It
      had reached its finality. He never guessed that, indirectly at least,
      Constance Emory was responsible for by far the greater part of Ryder's
      present bitterness. She objected to his partisanship of the men, and this
      only served to increase his verbal intemperance. But, in spite of the
      antagonism of their views, they remained friends. Constance was willing to
      endure much from Ryder that she would have resented from any one else. She
      liked him, and she was sorry for him; he seemed unhappy, and she imagined
      he suffered as she herself suffered, and from the same cause. There was
      still another motive for her forbearance, which, perhaps, she did not
      fully realize. The strike and Oakley had become a mania with the editor,
      and from him she was able to learn what Dan was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unpopularity of his son was a source of infinite grief to Roger
      Oakley. The more so as he took the burden of it on his own shoulders. He
      brooded over it until presently he decided that he would have a talk with
      Ryder and explain matters to him, and ask him to discontinue his abuse of
      Dan. There was a streak in the old convict's mind which was hardly sane,
      for no man spends the best years of his life in prison and comes out as
      clear-headed as he goes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he pottered about the shops with McClintock, he meditated on his
      project. He was sure, if he could show Ryder where he was wrong and
      unfair, he would hasten to make amends. It never occurred to him that
      Ryder had merely followed in the wake of public opinion, giving it
      definite expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening&mdash;and he chose the hour when he knew Antioch would be at
      supper and the streets deserted&mdash;he stole from the shops, without
      telling Dan where he was going, as he had a shrewd idea that he would put
      a veto on his scheme did he know of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his courage his pace slackened as he approached the <i>Herald</i>
      office. He possessed unbounded respect for print, and still greater
      respect for the man who spoke in print.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door stood open, and he looked in over the top of his steel-bowed
      spectacles. The office was dark and shadowy, but from an inner room, where
      the presses stood, a light shone. While he hesitated, the half-grown boy
      who was Griff's chief assistant came from the office. Roger Oakley placed
      a hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Ryder in, sonny?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he's in the back room, where you see the light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found Ryder busy making up, by the light of a single dingy lamp, for
      the <i>Herald</i> went to press in the morning. Griff gave a start of
      surprise when he saw who his visitor was; then he said, sharply, &ldquo;Well,
      sir, what can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time the old convict and the editor had met, and Roger
      Oakley, peering over his spectacles, studied Ryder's face in his usual
      slow fashion. At last he said: &ldquo;I hope I am not intruding, Mr. Ryder, for
      I'd like to speak with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be quick about it,&rdquo; snapped Griff. &ldquo;Don't you see I'm busy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the utmost deliberation the old convict took from his pocket a large
      red-and-yellow bandanna handkerchief. Then he removed his hat and wiped
      his face and neck with elaborate thoroughness. When he finally spoke he
      dropped his voice to an impressive whisper. &ldquo;I don't think you understand
      Dannie, Mr. Ryder, or the reasons for the trouble down at the shops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't I? Well, I'll be charmed to hear your explanation.&rdquo; And he put down
      the rule with which he had been measuring one of the printed columns on
      the table before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without being asked Roger Oakley seated himself in a chair by the door. He
      placed his hat and handkerchief on a corner of the table, and took off his
      spectacles, which he put into their case. Ryder watched him with curious
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew we could settle this, Mr. Ryder,&rdquo; said he, with friendly
      simplicity. &ldquo;You've been unfair to my son. That was because you did not
      understand. When you do, I am certain you will do what you can to make
      right the wrong you have done him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vicious, sinister smile wreathed Ryder's lips. He nodded. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dannie's done nothing to you to make you wish to hurt him&mdash;for you
      are hurting him. He don't admit it, but I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Ryder, tersely. &ldquo;I should hate to think my energy had
      been entirely wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of pained surprise crossed Roger Oakley's face. He was quite
      shocked at the unchristian feeling Griff was displaying. &ldquo;No, you don't
      mean that!&rdquo; he made haste to say. &ldquo;You can't mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't I?&rdquo; cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley stole a glance from under his thick, bushy eyebrows at the
      editor. He wondered if an apt quotation from the Scriptures would be of
      any assistance. The moral logic with which he had intended to overwhelm
      him had somehow gone astray-He presented the singular spectacle of a man
      who was in the wrong, and who knew he was in the wrong and was yet
      determined to persist in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something I'll tell you that I haven't told any one else.&rdquo; He
      glanced again at Ryder to see the effect of the proposed confidence, and
      again the latter nodded for him to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going away. I haven't told my son yet, but I've got it all planned,
      and when I am gone you won't have any reason to hate Dannie, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's an admirable idea, Mr. Oakley, and if Dannie, as you call him, has
      half your good-sense he'll follow your example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he can't leave. He must stay. He's the manager of the road,&rdquo; with
      evident pride. &ldquo;He's got to stay, but I'll go. Won't that do just as
      well?&rdquo; a little anxiously, for he could not fathom the look on Ryder's
      dark face. Ryder only gave him a smile in answer, and he continued,
      hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, the trouble's been about me and my working in the shops. If I
      hadn't come here there'd have been no strike. As for Dannie, he's made a
      man of himself. You don't know, and I don't know, how hard he's worked and
      how faithful he's been. What I've done mustn't reflect on him. It all
      happened when he was a little boy&mdash;so high,&rdquo; extending his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Oakley,&rdquo; said Ryder, coldly and insultingly, &ldquo;I propose, if I can, to
      make this town too hot to hold your son, and I am grateful to you for the
      unconscious compliment you have paid me by this visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dannie don't know I came,&rdquo; quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't suppose he does. I take it it was an inspiration of your
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley had risen from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's Dannie ever done to you?&rdquo; he asked, with just the least
      perceptible tremor in his tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryder shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;We don't need him in Antioch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man mastered his wrath, and said, gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't afford to be unfair, Mr. Ryder. No one can afford to be unfair.
      You are too young a man to persevere in what you know to be wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To maintain his composure required a great effort. In the riotous days of
      his youth he had concluded most arguments in which he had become involved
      with his fists. Aged and broken, his religion overlay his still vigorous
      physical strength but thinly, as a veneer. He squared his massive
      shoulders and stood erect, like a man in his prime, and glowered heavily
      on the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you have always been able to make right your guiding star,&rdquo;
       retorted Ryder, jeeringly. The anger instantly faded from the old
      convict's face. He was recalled to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily, that is, in the presence of others, Ryder would have felt
      bound to treat Roger Oakley with the deference due to his years. Alone, as
      they were, he was restrained by no such obligation. He was in an ugly
      mood, and he proceeded to give it rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to hell you'd mind your own business,&rdquo; he said, suddenly. &ldquo;What do
      you mean by coming here to tell me what I ought to do? If you want to
      know, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I am going to hound you and that
      precious son of yours out of this part of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man straightened up again as Ryder spoke. The restraint of years
      dropped from him in a twinkling. He told him he was a scoundrel, and he
      prefaced it with an oath&mdash;a slip he did not notice in his excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a damned scoundrel!&rdquo; repeated Roger Oakley, white with rage. He
      took a step around the table and came nearer the editor. &ldquo;I don't know but
      what I ought to break every bone in your body! You are trying to ruin my
      son!&rdquo; He hit the table a mighty blow with his clinched fist, and,
      thrusting his head forward, glared into Ryder's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have turned his friends against him. Why, he ain't got none left any
      more. They have all gone over to the other side; and you done it, you done
      it, and it's got to stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder had been taken aback for the moment by Roger Oakley's fierce anger,
      which vibrated in his voice and flashed in his dark, sunken eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of here,&rdquo; he shouted, losing control of himself. &ldquo;Get out or,
      damn you, I'll kick you out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I'm ready to go I'll leave,&rdquo; retorted the old man, calmly, &ldquo;and that
      will be when I've said my say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll go now,&rdquo; and he shoved him in the direction of the door. The shove
      was almost a blow, and as it fell on his broad chest Roger Oakley gave a
      hoarse, inarticulate cry and struck out with his heavy hand. Ryder
      staggered back, caught at the end of the table as he plunged past it, and
      fell his length upon the floor. The breath whistled sharply from the old
      man's lips. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;you'll keep your hands off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder did not speak nor move. All was hushed and still in the room.
      Suddenly a nervous chill seized the old convict. He shook from head to
      heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to hit you,&rdquo; he said, speaking to the prostrate figure at
      his feet. &ldquo;Here, let me help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and felt around on the floor until he found Ryder's hand. He
      released it instantly to take the lamp from the table. Then he knelt
      beside the editor. In the corner where the latter lay stood a rusty
      wood-stove. In his fall Griff's head had struck against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp shook in Roger Oakley's hand like a leaf in a gale. Ryder's eyes
      were open and seemed to look into his own with a mute reproach. For the
      rest he lay quite limp, his head twisted to one side. The old man felt of
      his heart. One or two minutes elapsed. His bearing was one of feverish
      intensity. He heard three men loiter by on the street, and the sound of
      their footfalls die off in the distance, but Ryder's heart had ceased to
      beat. Fully convinced of this, he returned the lamp to the table and,
      sitting down in the chair by the door, covered his face with his hands and
      sobbed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over and over he murmured: &ldquo;I've killed him, I've killed him! Poor boy!
      poor boy! I didn't goto do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently he got up and made a second examination. The man was dead past
      every doubt. His first impulse was to surrender himself to the town
      marshal, as he had done once before under similar circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he thought of Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he must escape, and perhaps it would never be known who had killed
      Ryder. His death might even be attributed to an accident. In his
      excitement he forgot the boy he had met at the door. That incident had
      passed entirely from his mind, and he did not remember the meeting until
      days afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been utterly indifferent to his own danger, but now he extinguished
      the lamp and made his way cautiously into the outer room and peered into
      the street. As he crouched in the darkness by the door he heard the town
      bell strike the hour. He counted the strokes. It was eight o'clock. An
      instant later and he was hurrying down the street, fleeing from the
      ghastly horror of the white, upturned face, and the eyes, with their look
      of mute reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the railroad track at the foot of Main Street, he paused
      irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could see Dannie once more, just once more!&rdquo; he muttered, under his
      breath; but he crossed the tracks with a single, longing look turned
      towards the shops, a black blur in the night a thousand yards distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Main Street became a dusty country road south of the tracks. He left it at
      this point and skirted a cornfield, going in the direction of the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the shops Dan had waited supper for his father until half-past seven,
      when he decided he must have gone up-town, probably to the Joyces'. So he
      had eaten his supper alone. Then he drew his chair in front of an open
      window and lighted his pipe. It was very hot in the office, and by-and-by
      he carried his lamp into the pattern-room, where he and his father slept.
      He arranged their two cots, blew out the light, which seemed to add to the
      heat, partly undressed, and lay down. He heard the town bell strike eight,
      and then the half-hour. Shortly after this he must have fallen asleep, for
      all at once he awoke with a start. From off in the night a confusion of
      sounds reached him. The town bell was ringing the alarm. At first he
      thought it was a fire, but there was no light in the sky, and the bell
      rang on and on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and put on his coat and hat and started out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was six blocks to the <i>Herald</i> office, and as he neared it he
      could distinguish a group of excited, half-dressed men and women where
      they clustered on the sidewalk before the building. A carriage was
      standing in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He elbowed into the crowd unnoticed and unrecognized. A small boy, who had
      climbed into the low boughs of a maple-tree, now shouted in a perfect
      frenzy of excitement: &ldquo;Hi! They are bringing him out! Jimmy Smith's got
      him by the legs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment Chris. Berry appeared in the doorway. The crowd stood
      on tiptoe, breathless, tense, and waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive up a little closter, Tom,&rdquo; Berry called to the man in the carriage.
      Then he stepped to one side, and two men pushed past him carrying the body
      of Ryder between them. The crowd gave a groan.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>YDER'S murder
      furnished Antioch with a sensation the like of which it had not known in
      many a day. It was one long, breathless shudder, ramified with contingent
      horrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dippy Ellsworth remembered that when he drove up in his cart on the night
      of the tragedy to light the street lamp which stood on the corner by the
      <i>Herald</i> office his horse had balked and refused to go near the curb.
      It was generally conceded that the sagacious brute smelled blood. Dippy
      himself said he would not sell that horse for a thousand dollars, and it
      was admitted on all sides that such an animal possessed a value hard to
      reckon in mere dollars and cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three men recalled that they had passed the <i>Herald</i> office and
      noticed that the door stood open. Within twenty-four hours they were
      hearing groans, and within a week, cries for help, but they were not
      encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the real hero was Bob Bennett, Ryder's assistant, who had
      discovered the body when he went back to the office at half-past eight to
      close the forms. His account of the finding of Ryder dead on the floor was
      an exceedingly grizzly narrative, delightfully conducive of the shivers.
      He had been the quietest of youths, but two weeks after the murder he left
      for Chicago. He said there might be those who could stand it, but Antioch
      was too slow for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not less remarkable was Ryder's posthumous fame. Men who had never known
      him in life now spoke of him with trembling voices and every outward
      evidence of the sincerest sorrow. It was as if they had sustained a
      personal loss, for his championship of the strike had given him a great
      popularity, and his murder, growing out of this championship, as all
      preferred to believe, made his death seem a species of martyrdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the mere fact that he had been murdered would have been sufficient
      to make him popular at any time. He had supplied Antioch with a glorious
      sensation. It was something to talk over and discuss and shudder at, and
      the town was grateful and happy, with the deep, calm joy of a perfect
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It determined to give him a funeral which should be creditable alike to
      the cause for which he had died and to the manner of his death. So
      widespread was the feeling that none should be denied a share in this
      universal expression of respect and grief that Jeffy found it easy to
      borrow five pairs of trousers, four coats, and a white vest to wear to the
      funeral; but, in spite of these unusual preparations, he was unable to be
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Dan had been arrested, examined, and set at liberty again, in
      the face of the prevailing sentiment that he should be held. No one
      doubted&mdash;he himself least of all&mdash;that Roger Oakley had killed
      Ryder. Bob Bennett recalled their meeting as he left the office to go home
      for supper on the night of the murder, and a red-and-yellow bandanna
      handkerchief was found under the table which Dan identified as having
      belonged to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenyon came to Antioch and made his re-election almost certain by the
      offer of a reward of five hundred dollars for the arrest and conviction of
      the murderer. This stimulated a wonderful measure of activity. Parties of
      men and boys were soon scouring the woods and fields in quest of the old
      convict.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day preceding that of the funeral a dusty countryman, on a hard-ridden
      plough-horse, dashed into town with the news that a man who answered
      perfectly to the description of Roger Oakley had been seen the night
      before twenty-six miles north of Antioch, at a place called Barrow's Saw
      Mills, where he had stopped at a store and made a number of purchases.
      Then he had struck off through the woods. It was also learned that he had
      eaten his breakfast the morning after the murder at a farmhouse midway
      between Antioch and Barrow's Saw Mills. The farmer's wife had, at his
      request, put up a lunch for him. Later in the day a man at work in a field
      had seen and spoken with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was neither railroad, telegraph, nor telephone at Barrow's Saw
      Mills, and the fugitive had evidently considered it safe to venture into
      the place, trusting that he was ahead of the news of his crime. It was on
      the edge of a sparsely settled district, and to the north of it was the
      unbroken wilderness stretching away to the lakes and the Wisconsin line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the funeral an extra edition of the <i>Herald</i> was
      issued, which contained a glowing account of Ryder's life and
      achievements. It was an open secret that it was from the gifted pen of
      Kenyon. This notable enterprise was one of the wonders of the day.
      Everybody wanted a <i>Herald</i> as a souvenir of the occasion, and nearly
      five hundred copies were sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that morning the country people, in unheard-of numbers, flocked into
      town. As Clarence remarked to Spide, it was just like a circus day. The
      noon train from Buckhom Junction arrived crowded to the doors, as did the
      one-o'clock train from Harrison. Antioch had never known anything like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral was at two o'clock from the little white frame Methodist
      church, but long before the appointed hour it was crowded to the verge of
      suffocation, and the anxious, waiting throng overflowed into the yard and
      street, with never a hope of wedging into the building, much less securing
      seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      A delegation of the strikers, the Young Men's Kenyon Club, of which Ryder
      was a member, and a representative body of citizens escorted the remains
      to the church. These were the people he had jeered at, whose simple joys
      he had ridiculed, and whose griefs he had made light of, but they would
      gladly have forgiven him his sarcasms even had they known of them. He had
      become a hero and a martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chris Berry and Cap Roberts were in charge of the arrangements. On the
      night of the murder the former had beaten his rival to the <i>Herald</i>
      office by exactly three minutes, and had never left Ryder until he lay in
      the most costly casket in his shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was admitted afterwards by thoughtful men, who were accustomed to weigh
      their opinions carefully, that Mr. Williamson, the minister, had never
      delivered so moving an address, nor one that contained so obvious a moral.
      The drift of his remarks was that the death of their brilliant and
      distinguished fellow-townsman should serve as a warning to all that there
      was no time like the present in which to prepare for the life everlasting.
      He assured his audience that each hour of existence should be devoted to
      consecration and silent testimony; otherwise, what did it avail? It was
      not enough that Ryder had thrown the weight of his personal influence and
      exceptional talents on the side of sound morality and civic usefulness.
      And as he soared on from point to point, his hearers soared with him, and
      when he rounded in on each well-tried climax, they rounded in with him. He
      never failed them once. They always knew what he was going to say before
      it was said, and were ready for the thrill when the thrill was due. It
      might have seemed that Mr. Williamson was paid a salary merely to make an
      uncertain hereafter yet more uncomfortable and uncertain, but Antioch took
      its religion hot, with a shiver and a threat of blue flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Williamson sat down Mr. Kenyon rose. As a layman he could be
      entirely eulogistic. He was sure of the faith which through life had been
      the guiding star of the departed. He had seen it instanced by numerous
      acts of eminently Christian benevolence, and on those rare occasions when
      he had spoken of his hopes and fears he had, in spite of his shrinking
      modesty, shown that his standards of Christian duty were both lofty and
      consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the Hon. Jeb Barrows, who had been dozing peacefully, awoke with a
      start, and gazed with wide, bulging eyes at the speaker. He followed Mr.
      Kenyon, and, though he tried hard, he couldn't recall any expression of
      Ryder's, at the Red Star bar or elsewhere, which indicated that there was
      any spiritual uplift to his nature which he fed at secret altars; so he
      pictured the friend and citizen, and the dead fared well at his hands,
      perhaps better than he was conscious of, for he said no more than he
      believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the prayer and hymn, to be succeeded by a heavy, solemn pause,
      and Mr. Williamson stepped to the front of the platform-.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All those who care to view the remains&mdash;and I presume there are many
      here who will wish to look upon the face of our dead friend before it is
      conveyed to its final resting-place&mdash;will please form in line at the
      rear of the edifice and advance quietly up the right aisle, passing across
      the church as quickly as possible and thence down the left aisle and on
      out through the door. This will prevent confusion and make it much
      pleasanter for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a rustle of skirts and the awkward shuffling of many feet as the
      congregation formed in line; then it filed slowly up the aisle to where
      Chris Berry stood, weazened and dry, with a vulture look on his face and a
      vulture touch to his hands that now and again picked at the flowers which
      were banked about the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emorys, partly out of regard for public sentiment, had attended the
      funeral, for, as the doctor said, they were the only real friends Griff
      had in the town. They had known and liked him when the rest of Antioch was
      dubiously critical of the new-comer, whose ways were not its ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the congregation thronged up the aisle, Constance, who had endured
      the long service, which to her was unspeakably grotesque and horrible, in
      shocked if silent rebellion slipped her hand into her mother's. &ldquo;Take me
      away,&rdquo; she whispered, brokenly, &ldquo;or I shall cry out! Take me away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Emory hesitated. It seemed a desertion of a trust to go and leave
      Griff to these strangers, who had been brought there by morbid curiosity.
      Constance guessed what was passing in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa will remain if it is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Emory touched the doctor on the shoulder. &ldquo;We're going home, John;
      Constance doesn't feel well; but you stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the street the last vestige of Constance's self-control
      vanished utterly. &ldquo;Wasn't it awful!&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;and his life had only
      just begun! And to be snuffed out like this, when there was everything to
      live for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Emory, surprised at the sudden show of feeling, looked into her
      daughter's face. Constance understood the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! He was only a friend! He could never have been more than that.
      Poor, poor Griff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad for your sake, dearie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Emory, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't very kind to him at the last, but I couldn't know&mdash;I
      couldn't know,&rdquo; she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not much given to these confidences, even with her mother. Usually
      she never questioned the wisdom or righteousness of her own acts, and it
      was not her habit to put them to the test of a less generous judgment. But
      she was remembering her last meeting with Ryder. It had been the day
      before his death; he had told her that he loved her, and she had flared
      up, furious and resentful, with the dull, accusing ache of many days in
      her heart, and a cruel readiness to make him suffer. She had tried to
      convince herself afterwards that it was only his vanity that was hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she thought of Oakley. She had been thinking of him all day,
      wondering where he was, if he had left Antioch, and not daring to ask.
      They were going up the path now towards the house, and she turned to her
      mother again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say of Mr. Oakley&mdash;I mean Mr. Dan Oakley? I don't know
      why, but I'm more sorry for him than I am for Griff; he has so much to
      bear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard your father say he was still here. I suppose he has to remain. He
      can't choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will be done with his father if he is captured? Will they&mdash;&rdquo;
       She could not bring herself to finish the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness knows! I wouldn't worry about him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Emory, in a tone
      of considerable asperity. &ldquo;He's made all the trouble, and I haven't a
      particle of patience with him!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>Y three o'clock
      the saloons and stores, which had closed at noon, opened their doors, and
      Antioch emerged from the shadow of its funeral gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      By four o'clock a long procession of carriages and wagons was rumbling out
      of town. Those who had come from a distance were going home, but many
      lingered in the hope that the excitement was not all past.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later a rumor reached Antioch that Roger Oakley had been captured.
      It spread about the streets like wildfire and penetrated to the stores and
      saloons. At first it was not believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just who was responsible for the rumor no one knew, and no one cared, but
      soon the additional facts were being vouched for by a score of excited men
      that a search-party from Barrow's Saw Mills, which had been trailing the
      fugitive for two days, had effected his capture after a desperate fight in
      the northern woods, and were bringing him to Antioch for identification.
      It was generally understood that if the prisoner proved to be Roger Oakley
      he would be spared the uncertainty of a trial. The threat was made openly
      that he would be strung up to the first convenient lamp-post. As Mr. Britt
      remarked to a customer from Harrison, for whom he was mixing a cocktail:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'd be a pity to keep a man of his years waiting; and what's the use of
      spending thousands of dollars for a conviction, anyhow, when everybody
      knows he done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Jim Brown, the sheriff, and Joe Weaver, the town marshal,
      were seen to cross the square with an air of importance and preoccupation.
      It was noted casually that the right-hand coat-pocket of each sagged
      suggestively. They disappeared into McElroy's livery-stable. Fifty men and
      boys rushed precipitately in pursuit, and were just in time to see the two
      officers pass out at the back of the stable and jump into a light
      road-cart that stood in the alley. A moment later and they were whirling
      off up-town.
    </p>
    <p>
      All previous doubt vanished instantly. It was agreed on all sides that
      they were probably acting on private information, and had gone to bring in
      the prisoner. So strong was this conviction that a number of young men,
      whose teams were hitched about the square, promptly followed, and soon an
      anxious cavalcade emptied itself into the dusty country road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just beyond the corporation line the North Street, as it was called,
      forked. Mr. Brown and his companion had taken the road which bore to the
      west and led straight to Barrow's Saw Mills. Those who were first to reach
      the forks could still see the road-cart a black dot in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon passed, and the dusk of evening came. Those of the
      townspeople who were still hanging about the square went home to supper.
      Unless a man could hire or borrow a horse there was not much temptation to
      start off on a wild-goose chase, which, after all, might end only at
      Barrow's Saw Mills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for him, Dan Oakley had gone to Chicago that morning,
      intending to see Holloway and resign. In view of what had happened it was
      impossible for him to remain in Antioch, nor could General Cornish expect
      him to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milton McClintock was at supper with his family, when Mrs. Stapleton, who
      lived next door, broke in upon them without ceremony, crying, excitedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've got him, and they're going to lynch him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she as suddenly disappeared. McClintock, from where he sat, holding a
      piece of bread within an inch of his lips, and his mouth wide open to
      receive it, could see her through the window, her gray hair dishevelled
      and tossed about her face, running from house to house, a gaunt rumor in
      flapping calico skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet when he saw her vanish around the corner of Lou
      Bentick's house across the way. &ldquo;You keep the children in, Mary,&rdquo; he said,
      sharply. &ldquo;Don't let them into the street.&rdquo; And, snatching up his hat and
      coat, he made for the door, but his wife was there ahead of him and threw
      her arms about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, Milt, stay with the boys and me!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;You
      don't know what may happen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside they heard the trampling of many feet coming nearer and nearer.
      They listened breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what may happen!&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do, and they mustn't do it!&rdquo; unclasping her hands. &ldquo;Jim will be
      needing help.&rdquo; The sheriff was his wife's brother. &ldquo;He's promised me he'd
      hang the old man himself, or no one else should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence now in the street. The crowd had swept past the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the town's full of strangers. You can't do anything, and Jim can't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can try. Look out for the children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. McClintock turned to the boys, who were still at the table. &ldquo;Go
      up-stairs to your room and stay there until I tell you to come down,&rdquo; she
      commanded, peremptorily. &ldquo;There, don't bother me with questions!&rdquo; For Joe,
      the youngest boy, was already whimpering. The other two, with white,
      scared faces, sat bolt upright in their chairs. Some danger threatened;
      they didn't know what this danger was, and their very ignorance added to
      their terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what I say!&rdquo; she cried. At this they left the table and marched
      towards the stairs. Joe found courage to say: &ldquo;Ain't you coming, too?
      George's afraid.&rdquo; But his mother did not hear him. She was at the window
      closing the shutters. In the next yard she saw old Mrs. Smith, Mrs.
      Stapleton's mother, carrying her potted plants into the house and scolding
      in a shrill, querulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      McClintock, pulling on his coat as he ran, hurried up the street past the
      little white frame Methodist church. The crowd had the start of him, and
      the town seemed deserted, except for the women and children, who were
      everywhere, at open doors and windows, some pallid and pitying, some ugly
      with the brutal excitement they had caught from brothers or husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed the Emorys', he heard his name called. He glanced around, and
      saw the doctor standing on the porch with Mrs. Emory and Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go with me, McClintock?&rdquo; the physician cried. At the same moment
      the boy drove his team to the door. McClintock took the fence at a bound
      and ran up the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no time to lose,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; with a sudden, sickening
      sense of helplessness, &ldquo;I don't know that we can stop them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least he will not be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Constance who spoke. She was thinking of Oakley as struggling
      single-handed to save his father from the howling, cursing rabble which
      had rushed up the street ten minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he won't be alone,&rdquo; said McClintock, not understanding whom it was
      she meant. He climbed in beside the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't seen him?&rdquo; the latter asked, as he took the reins from the
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan Oakley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's on his way to Chicago. Went this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; and he pulled in his horses to call back to
      Constance that Oakley had left Antioch. A look of instant relief came into
      her face. He turned again to McClintock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a bad business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we don't want no lynching, but it's lucky Oakley isn't here. I
      hadn't thought of what he'd do if he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity he ever sent for his father! but who could have foreseen
      this?&rdquo; said the doctor, sadly. McClintock shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't believe the old man killed Ryder in cold blood. Why, he's as
      gentle as a lamb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they left the town, off to the right in a field they saw a bareheaded
      woman racing after her two runaway sons, and then the distant shouts of
      men, mingled with the shrill cries of boys, reached their ears. The doctor
      shook out his reins and plied his whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if we are too late!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer McClintock swore. He was fearing that himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later and they were up with the rear of the mob, where it
      straggled along on foot, sweating and dusty and hoarsely articulate. A
      little farther on and it was lost to sight in a thicketed dip of the road.
      Out of this black shadow buggy after buggy flashed to show in the red dusk
      that lay on the treeless hill-side beyond. On the mob's either flank, but
      keeping well out of the reach of their elders, slunk and skulked the
      village urchins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks as if all Antioch was here to-night,&rdquo; commented McClintock, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for us; surely they are not all gone mad,&rdquo; answered
      the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't give a button for his chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor drove recklessly into the crowd, which scattered to the right
      and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      McClintock, bending low, scanned the faces which were raised towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole township's here. I don't know one in ten,&rdquo; he said,
      straightening up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could manage to run over a few,&rdquo; muttered the doctor, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they neared the forks of the road Dr. Emory pulled in his horses. A
      heavy farm-wagon blocked the way, and the driver was stolidly indifferent
      alike to his entreaties and to McClintock's threat to break his head for
      him if he didn't move on. They were still shouting at him, when a savage
      cry swelled up from the throats of those in advance. The murderer was
      being brought in from the east road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brutes!&rdquo; muttered the doctor, and he turned helplessly to McClintock.
      &ldquo;What are we going to do? What can we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By way of answer McClintock stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could see Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jim had taken the west road three hours be-fore, and was driving
      towards Barrow's Saw Mills as fast as McElroy's best team could take him.
      When he reached there it was enough to make one's blood run cold to hear
      the good man curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait here, doctor,&rdquo; cried McClintock. &ldquo;You can't get past, and they
      seem to be coming this way now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for yourself, Milt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped down into the dusty, trampled road, and foot by foot fought his
      way forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had said, those in front were turning back. The result was a
      horrible jam, for those behind were still struggling to get within sight
      of the murderer. A drunken man at McClintock's elbow was shouting, &ldquo;Lynch
      him!&rdquo; at the top of his lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master-mechanic wrenched an arm free and struck at him with the flat
      of his hand. The man appeared surprised, but not at all angry. He merely
      wiped the blood from his lips and asked, in an injured tone, which
      conveyed a mild reproof, &ldquo;What did you want to do that for? I don't know
      you,&rdquo; and as he sought to maintain his place at McClintock's side he kept
      repeating, &ldquo;Say, neighbor, I don't know you. You certainly got the
      advantage of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon McClintock was in the very thick of the mob, and then he saw the
      captive. His hands were bound and he was tied with ropes to the front seat
      of a buckboard drawn by two jaded horses. His captors were three
      iron-jawed, hard-faced countrymen. They were armed with shot-guns, and
      were enjoying their splendid triumph to the full.
    </p>
    <p>
      McClintock gave only one look at the prisoner. An agony of fear was on
      him. The collar of his shirt was stiff with blood from a wounded face. His
      hat was gone, and his coat was torn. Scared and wondering, his eyes
      shifted uneasily over the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the one look sufficed McClintock, and he lost all interest in the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      There would be no lynching that night, for the man was not Roger Oakley.
      Further than that, he was gray-haired and burly; he was as unlike the old
      convict as one man could well be unlike another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the cry was raised, &ldquo;It ain't him. You fellows got the wrong
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cry was taken up and bandied back down the road. The mob drew a great,
      free breath of rejoicing. It became good-natured with a noisy hilarity.
      The iron-jawed countrymen glanced around sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure about that?&rdquo; one inquired. &ldquo;He answers the description all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was hard to have to abandon the idea of the rewards. &ldquo;What have you
      been doing to him?&rdquo; asked half a dozen voices in chorus They felt a
      friendly interest in the poor bound wretch in the buckboard; perhaps, too,
      they were grateful to him because he was the wrong man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing much,&rdquo; uneasily, &ldquo;only he put up a hell of a fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he did. He didn't want to be hanged!&rdquo; And there was a
      good-natured roar from the crowd. Already those nearest the prisoner were
      reaching up to throw off the ropes that bound him. His captors looked on
      in stupid surprise, but did not seek to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner himself, now that he saw he was surrounded by well-wishers,
      and being in a somewhat surly temper, which was pardonable enough under
      the circumstances, fell to complaining bitterly and loudly of the
      treatment he had received. Presently the mob began to disperse, some to
      slink back into town, rather ashamed of their fury, while the
      ever-lengthening procession which had followed the four men in the
      buckboard since early in the day faced about and drove off into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterwards and the prisoner was airing his grievances in sagacious
      Mr. Britt's saloon, whither he had been conveyed by the latter gentleman,
      who had been quick to recognize that, temporarily, at least, he possessed
      great drawing-powers. He was only a battered vagabond on his way East from
      the harvests in the Dakota wheat-fields, and he knew that he had looked
      into the very eyes of death. As he limped about the place, not disdaining
      to drink with whoever offered to pay for his refreshment, he nursed a
      bruised and blackened ear, where some enthusiast had planted his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just suppose they hadn't seen I was the wrong man! Gosh damn 'em! they'd
      a strung me up to the nearest sapling. I'd like to meet the cuss that
      punched me in the ear!&rdquo; The crowd smiled tolerantly and benevolently upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did they come to get you?&rdquo; asked one of his auditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was doing a flit across the State on foot looking for work, and camping
      in the woods nights. How the bloody blazes was I to know you'd had a
      murder in your jay town? They jumped on me while I was asleep, that's what
      they done. Three of 'em, and when I says, 'What the hell you want of me?'
      one of 'em yells, 'We know you. Surrender!' and jabs the butt of his gun
      into my jaw, and over I go. Then another one yells, 'He's feeling for his
      knife!' and he rushes in and lets drive with his fist and fetches me a
      soaker in the neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About the same hour two small figures brushed past Chris Berry as he came
      up Main Street, and he heard a familiar voice say: &ldquo;My, wasn't it a close
      call, Spide? He was just saved by the skin of his teeth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hand was extended, and the speaker felt himself seized by the ear, and,
      glancing up, looked into his father's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come along home with me, son,&rdquo; said the undertaker. &ldquo;Your ma 'll have
      a word to say to you. She's been wanting to lay her hands on you all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you later, Spide,&rdquo; Clarence managed to gasp, and then he moved off
      with a certain jaunty buoyancy, as though he trod on air.

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Roger Oakley
      fled from Antioch on the night of the murder he was resolved that, happen
      what might, he would not be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour he traversed back alleys and grass-grown &ldquo;side streets,&rdquo;
       seeing no one and unseen, and presently found himself to the north of the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat down to rest and consider the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on the smooth, round top of a hill-side. At his back were woods and
      fields, while down in the hollow below him, beyond a middle space that was
      neither town nor country, he saw the lights of Antioch twinkling among the
      trees. Dannie was there somewhere, wondering why he did not return. Nearer
      at hand, across a narrow lane, where the rag-weed and jimson and pokeberry
      flourished rankly, was the cemetery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first peaceful month of his stay in Antioch he had walked out there
      almost every Sunday afternoon to smoke his pipe and meditate. He had liked
      to hear the blackbirds calling overhead in the dark pines, and he had a
      more than passing fondness for tombstone literature. Next to the Bible it
      seemed about the soundest kind of reading. He would seat himself beside a
      grave whose tenant had been singularly pre-eminent as possessing all the
      virtues, and, in friendly fellowship with the dead, watch the shadows
      marshalled by the distant woodlands grow from short to long, or listen to
      the noisy cawing of the crows off in the cornfields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was profoundly still, until suddenly the town bell rang the
      alarm. The old convict's face blanched at the sound, and he came slowly to
      his feet. The bell rang on. The lights among the trees grew in number,
      dogs barked, there was the murmur of voices. He clapped his hands to his
      ears and plunged into the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no clear idea of where he was going, but all night long he plodded
      steadily forward, his one thought to be as far from Antioch as possible by
      morning. When at last morning came, with its song of half-awakened birds
      and its level streaks of light piercing the gray dawn, he remembered that
      he was hungry, and that he had eaten nothing since noon the day before. He
      stopped at the first farmhouse he came to for breakfast, and at his
      request the farmer's wife put up a lunch for him to carry away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was night again when he reached Barrow's Saw Mills. He ventured boldly
      into the one general store and made a number of purchases. The storekeeper
      was frankly curious to learn what he was doing and where he was going, but
      the old convict met his questions with surly reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he left the store he took the one road out of the place, and half a
      mile farther on forsook the road for the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly midnight when he went into camp. He built a fire and toasted
      some thin strips of bacon. He made his supper of these and a few crackers.
      He realized that he must harbor his slender stock of provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had told himself over and over that he was not fit to live among men.
      He would have to dwell alone like a dangerous animal, shunning his
      fellows. The solitude and the loneliness suited him. He would make a
      permanent camp somewhere close to the lakes, in the wildest spot he could
      find, and end his days there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried in his pocket a small railroad map of the State, and in the
      morning, after a careful study of it, marked out his course. That day, and
      for several days following, he plodded on and on in a tireless, patient
      fashion, and with but the briefest stops at noon for his meagre lunch.
      Each morning he was up and on his way with the first glimmer of light, and
      he kept his even pace until the glow faded from the sky in the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond Barrow's Saw Mills the pine-woods stretched away to the north in
      one unbroken wilderness. At long intervals he passed loggers' camps, and
      more rarely a farm in the forest; but he avoided these. Instinct told him
      that the news of Ryder's murder had travelled far and wide. In all that
      range of country there was no inhabited spot where he dare show his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he had evolved a definite purpose he was quite cheerful and
      happy, save for occasional spells of depression and bitter
      self-accusation, but the excitement of his flight buoyed him up amazingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had distanced and outwitted pursuit, and his old pride in his physical
      strength and superiority returned. The woods never ceased to interest him.
      There was a mighty freedom about them, a freedom he shared and joyed in.
      He felt he could tramp on forever, with the scent of the pines filling his
      nostrils and the sweep of the wind in his ears. His muscles seemed of
      iron. There was cunning and craft, too, in the life he was living.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days were sultry August days. No rain had fallen in weeks, and the
      earth was a dead, dry brown. A hot haze quivered under the great trees.
      Off in the north, against which his face was set, a long, low, black cloud
      lay on the horizon. Sometimes the wind lifted it higher, and it sifted
      down dark threads of color against the softer blue of the summer sky.
      Presently the wind brought the odor of smoke. At first it was almost
      imperceptible&mdash;a suggestion merely, but by-and-by it was in every
      breath he drew. The forest was on fire ahead of him. He judged that the
      tide of devastation was rolling nearer, and he veered to the west. Then
      one evening he saw what he had not seen before&mdash;a dull red light that
      shone sullenly above the pines. The next day the smoke was thick in the
      woods; the wind, blowing strongly from the north, floated little wisps and
      wreaths of it down upon him. It rested like a heavy mist above the cool
      surface of the lake, on the shores of which he had made his camp the night
      previous, while some thickly grown depressions he crossed were sour with
      the stale, rancid odor that clung to his clothes and rendered breathing
      difficult. There was a powdering of fine white ashes everywhere. At first
      it resembled a hoar-frost, and then a scanty fall of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      By five o'clock he gained the summit of a low ridge. From its top he was
      able to secure an extended view of the fire. A red line&mdash;as red as
      the reddest sunset&mdash;stretched away to the north as far as the eye
      could see. He was profoundly impressed by the spectacle. The conflagration
      was on a scale so gigantic that it fairly staggered him. He knew millions
      of feet of timber must be blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to remain on the ridge and study the course of the fire, so he
      lay down to rest. Sleep came over him, for the day had been a fatiguing
      one, but at midnight he awoke. A dull, roaring sound was surging through
      the forest, and the air was stifling. The fire had burned closer while he
      slept. It had reached the ridge opposite, which was nearly parallel to the
      one he was on, and was burning along its northern base. The ridge
      flattened perceptibly to the west, and already at this point a single lone
      line of fire had surmounted the blunt crest, and was creeping down into
      the valley which intervened. Presently tongues, of fire shot upwards. The
      dark, nearer side of the ridge showed clearly in the fierce light, and
      soon the fire rolled over its entire length, a long, ruddy cataract of
      flame. As it gained the summit it seemed to fall forward and catch fresh
      timber, then it raced down the slope towards the valley, forming a great
      red avalanche that roared and hissed and crackled and sent up vast clouds
      of smoke into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly any attempt to go farther north would be but a waste of time and
      strength. The fire shut him off completely in that quarter. He must
      retrace his steps until he was well to the south again. Then he could go
      either to the east or west, and perhaps work around into the burned
      district. The risk he ran of capture did not worry him. Indeed, he
      scarcely considered it. He felt certain the pursuit, if pursuit there
      were, had been abandoned days before. He had a shrewd idea that the fire
      would give people something else to think of. His only fear was that his
      provisions would be exhausted. When they went he knew the chances were
      that he would starve, but he put this fear resolutely aside whenever it
      obtruded itself. With care his supplies could be made to last many days.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not sleep any more that night, but watched the fire eat its way
      across the valley. When it reached the slope at his feet he shouldered his
      pack and started south. It was noon when he made his first halt. He rested
      for two hours and then resumed his march. He was now well beyond the
      immediate range of the conflagration. There was only an occasional faint
      odor of smoke in the woods. He had crossed several small streams, and he
      knew they would be an obstacle in the path of the fire unless the wind,
      which was from the north, should freshen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night fell. He lighted a camp-fire and scraped together his bed of
      pine-needles, and lay down to sleep with the comforting thought that he
      had put a sufficient distance between himself and the burning forest. He
      would turn to the west when morning came. He trusted to a long day's
      journey to carry him out of the menaced territory. It would be easier
      travelling, too, for the ridges which cut the face of the country ran east
      and west. The sun was in the boughs of the hemlocks when he awoke. There
      had been a light rain during the night, and the forest world had taken on
      new beauty. But it grew hot and oppressive as the hours passed. The smoke
      thickened once more. At first he tried to believe it was only his fancy.
      Then the wind shifted into the east, and the woods became noticeably
      clearer. He pushed ahead with renewed hope. This change in the wind was a
      good sign. If it ever got into the south it would drive the fire back on
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tramped for half the night and threw himself down and slept heavily&mdash;the
      sleep of utter exhaustion and weariness. It was broad day when he opened
      his eyes. The first sound he heard was the dull roar of the flames. He
      turned with a hunted, fugitive look towards the west. A bright light shone
      through the trees. The fire was creeping around and already encircled him
      on two sides. His feeling was one of bitter disappointment, fear, too,
      mingled with it. In the south were Ryder's friends&mdash;Dannie's enemies
      and his. Of the east he had a horror which the study of his map did not
      tend to allay; there were towns there, and settlements, thickly scattered.
      Finally he concluded he would go forward and examine the line of fire.
      There might be some means by which he could make his way through it.

    <p>
      A journey of two miles brought him to a small watercourse. The fire was
      burning along the opposite bank. It blazed among the scrub and underbrush
      and leaped from tree to tree; first to shrivel their foliage to a dead,
      dry brown, and then envelop them in sheets of flame. The crackling was
      like the report of musketry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley was awed by the sight. In spite of the smoke and heat he sat
      down on the trunk of a fallen pine to rest. Some birds fluttered out of
      the rolling masses of smoke above his head and flew south with shrill
      cries of alarm. A deer crossed the stream, not two hundred yards from
      where he sat, at a single bound. Next, two large timber wolves entered the
      water. They landed within a stone's throw of him, and trotted leisurely
      off. The heat soon drove him from his position, and he, too, sought refuge
      in the south. The wall of flame cut him off from the north and west, and
      to the east he would not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something tragic in this blocking of his way. He wondered if it
      was not the Lord's wish, after all, that he should be taken. This thought
      had been troubling him for some time. Then he remembered Dannie. Dannie,
      to whom he had brought only shame and sorrow. He set his lips with grim
      determination. Right or wrong, the Lord's vengeance would have to wait.
      Perhaps He would understand the situation. He prayed that He might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-four hours later and he had turned westward, with the desperate
      hope that he could cross out of the path of the fire, but the hope proved
      futile. There was no help for it. To the east he must go if he would
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the towns and settlements he feared most, and the people; perhaps
      they still continued the search. When he left the wilderness the one
      precaution he could take would be to travel only by night. This plan, when
      it was firmly fixed in his mind, greatly encouraged him. But at the end of
      ten hours of steady tramping he discovered that the fire surrounded him on
      three sides. Still he did not despair. For two days he dodged from east to
      west, and each day the wall of flame and smoke drew closer about him, and
      the distances in which he moved became less and less. And now a great fear
      of Antioch possessed him. The railroad ran nearly due east and west from
      Buckhom Junction to Harrison, a distance of ninety-five miles. Beyond the
      road the country was well settled. There were thriving farms and villages.
      To pass through such a country without being seen was next to impossible.
      He felt a measure of his strength fail him, and with it went his courage.
      It was only the thought of Dannie that kept him on the alert. Happen what
      might, he would not be taken. It should go hard with the man or men who
      made the attempt. He told himself this, not boastfully, but with quiet
      conviction. In so far as he could, as the fire crowded him back, he
      avoided the vicinity of Antioch and inclined towards Buckhorn Junction.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was need of constant vigilance now, as he was in a sparsely settled
      section. One night some men passed quite near to the fringe of tamarack
      swamp where he was camped. Luckily the undergrowth was dense, and his fire
      had burned to a few red embers. On another occasion, just at dusk, he
      stumbled into a small clearing, and within plain view of the windows of a
      log-cabin. As he leaped back into the woods a man with a cob-pipe in his
      mouth came to the door of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley, with the hickory staff which he had cut that day held firmly
      in his hands, and a fierce, wild look on his face, watched him from his
      cover. Presently the man turned back into the house, closing the door
      after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These experiences startled and alarmed him. He grew gaunt and haggard; a
      terrible weariness oppressed him; his mind became confused, and a sort of
      panic seized him. His provisions had failed him, but an occasional
      cultivated field furnished corn and potatoes, in spite of the serious
      misgivings he felt concerning the moral aspect of these nightly
      depredations. When he raided a spring-house, and carried off eggs and
      butter and milk, he was able to leave money behind. He conducted these
      transactions with scrupulous honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been living in the wilderness three weeks, when at last the fire
      drove him from cover at Buck-horn Junction. As a town the Junction was
      largely a fiction. There was a railroad crossing, a freight-shed, and the
      depot, and perhaps a score of houses scattered along a sandy stretch of
      country road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The B. &amp; A. had its connection with the M. &amp; W. at this point. It
      was also the beginning of a rich agricultural district, and the woods gave
      place to cultivated fields and farm-lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late afternoon as Roger Oakley approached Buckhorn. When it was
      dark he would cross the railroad and take his chance there. He judged from
      the light in the sky that the fire had already burned in between Buckhom
      and Antioch. This gave him a certain sense of security. Indeed, the fire
      surrounded Buckhorn in every quarter except the south. Where there was no
      timber or brush it crept along the rail-fences, or ran with tiny spurts of
      flame through the dry weeds and dead stubble which covered much of the
      cleared land.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see a number of people moving about, a quarter of a mile west of
      the depot. They were tearing down a burning fence that was in perilous
      proximity to some straw-stacks and a barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard and saw the 6.50 on the M. &amp; W. pull in. This was the Chicago
      express; and the Huckleberry's local, which was due at Antioch at
      midnight, connected with it. This connection involved a wait of three
      hours at Buckhom. Only one passenger left the train. He disappeared into
      the depot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley waited until it was quite dark, and then, leaving the strip
      of woods just back of the depot, where he had been hiding, stole
      cautiously down to the track. He had noticed that there was an engine and
      some freight cars on one of the sidings. He moved among them, keeping well
      in the shadow. Suddenly he paused. Two men emerged from the depot. They
      came down the platform in the direction of the cars. They were talking
      earnestly together. One swung himself up into the engine and lighted a
      torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered what they were doing, and stole nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing on the platform now, and the man who held the torch had
      his back to him. His companion was saying something about the wires being
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antioch was in danger, and if Antioch was in danger&mdash;Dannie&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the man with the torch turned and its light Suffused his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Dan Oakley.

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>AN OAKLEY went to
      Chicago, intending to see Holloway and resign, but he found that the
      Huckleberry's vice-president was in New York on business, and no one in
      his office seemed to know when he would return, so he sat down and wrote a
      letter, telling him of the condition of affairs at Antioch, and explaining
      the utter futility, in view of what had happened, of his trying to cope
      with the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited five days for a reply, and, none coming, wired to learn if his
      letter had been received. This produced results. Holloway wired back that
      he had the letter under consideration, and requested Oakley to remain in
      Chicago until he returned, but he did not say whether or not his
      resignation would be accepted. Since there was nothing to be done but
      await Holloway's pleasure in the matter, Dan employed his enforced leisure
      in looking about for another position. He desired a connection which would
      take him out of the country, for the farther away from Antioch and
      Constance Emory he could get the better he would be satisfied. He fancied
      he would like to go to South America. He was willing to accept almost any
      kind of a post&mdash;salary was no longer a consideration with him. What
      he required was a radical change, with plenty of hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be wondered at that his judgment of the case was an extreme
      one, or that he told himself he must make a fresh start, as his record was
      very much against him and his ability at a discount. While he could not
      fairly be held responsible for the miscarriage of his plans at Antioch, he
      felt their failure keenly, so keenly that could he have seen the glimmer
      of a hope ahead he could have gone back and taken up the struggle, but the
      killing of Ryder by his father made this impossible. There was nothing he
      could do, and his mere presence outraged the whole town. No understanding
      would ever be reached with the hands if he continued in control, while a
      new man in his place would probably have little or no difficulty in coming
      to an agreement with them. No doubt they were quite as sick as he had been
      of the fight, and if he left they would be content to count his going a
      victory, and waive the question of wages. It was part of the irony of the
      condition that the new man would find enough work contracted for to keep
      the shop open and running full time for the next eight or ten months. But
      his successor was welcome to the glory of it when he had hidden himself in
      some God-forsaken corner of the globe along with the other waifs and
      strays&mdash;the men who have left home because of their health or their
      accounts, and who hang around dingy seaport towns and read month-old
      newspapers and try to believe that the game has been worth the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      By far his greatest anxiety was his father. He watched the papers closely,
      expecting each day to read that he had been captured and sent back to
      Antioch, but the days slipped past, and there was no mention of him. Holt,
      with whom he was in constant correspondence, reported that interest in his
      capture had considerably abated, while the organized pursuit had entirely
      ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan had the feeling that he should never see him again, and the pathos of
      his age and dependence tore his heart. In a manner, too, he blamed himself
      for the tragedy. It might have been averted had he said less about Ryder
      in his father's hearing. He should have known better than to discuss the
      strike with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, as he left Holloway's office, he chanced to meet an
      acquaintance by the name of Curtice. They had been together in Denver
      years before, and he had known him as a rather talkative young fellow,
      with large hopes and a thrifty eye to the main chance. But he was the one
      man he would have preferred to meet, for he had been in South America and
      knew the field there. Apparently Curtice was equally glad to see him. He
      insisted upon carrying him off to his club to lunch, where it developed he
      was in a state of happy enthusiasm over his connection with a road that
      had just gone into the hands of a receiver, and a new baby, which he
      assured Oakley on the spur of the moment he was going to name after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Oakley,&rdquo; he explained, as they settled themselves, &ldquo;I was
      married after you left to a girl who had come to Denver with a consumptive
      brother. They boarded at the same place I did.&rdquo; His companion was properly
      interested. &ldquo;Look here, how long are you going to be in the city? I want
      you to come and see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan avoided committing himself by saying his stay in Chicago was most
      uncertain. He might have to leave very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you must drop in at my office. I wish you'd make it your
      headquarters while you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the road you are with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the road! We are putting it in shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley smiled a trifle skeptically. He recalled that even as a very young
      man filling a very subordinate position, Curtice had clung to the &ldquo;we.&rdquo;
       Curtice saw the smile and remembered too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here, I'm giving it to you straight. I really am the whole
      thing. I've got a greenhorn for a boss, whose ignorance of the business is
      only equalled by his confidence in me. If you want to be nasty you can say
      his ignorance is responsible for much of his confidence. I've been told
      that before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll wait. I may be able to think of something better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are times when I wonder if he really knows the difference between
      an engine's head-light and a coupling-pin. He's giving me all the rope I
      want, and we'll have a great passenger service when I get done. That's
      what I am working on now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are you going to get the funds for it? A good service costs
      money,&rdquo; said Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the road's always made money. That was the trouble.&rdquo; Oakley looked
      dense. He had heard of such things, but they had been outside of his own
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The directors were a superstitious lot; they didn't believe in paying
      dividends, and as they had to get rid of the money somehow, they put it
      all out in salaries. The president's idea of the value of his own services
      would have been exorbitant if the road had been operating five thousand
      miles of track instead of five hundred. I am told a directors' meeting
      looked like a family reunion, and they had a most ungodly lot of nephews&mdash;nephews
      were everywhere. The purchasing agent was a nephew, so were two of the
      division superintendents. Why, the president even had a third cousin of
      his wife's braking on a way freight. We've kept him as a sort of
      curiosity, and because he was the only one in the bunch who was earning
      his pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder the stockholders went to law,&rdquo; said Oakley, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, when the road was taken into court its affairs were seen to be
      in such rotten shape that a receiver was appointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley's business instinct asserted itself. He had forgotten for the time
      being that his services still belonged to Cornish. Now he said: &ldquo;See here,
      haven't you cars you intend to rebuild?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;We've precious few that don't need carpenter-work or paint or
      upholstering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then send them to me at Antioch. I'll make you a price you can't get
      inside of, I don't care where you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Curtice meditated, then he asked: &ldquo;How are you fixed to handle a big
      contract? It 'll be mostly for paint and upholstery or woodwork. We have
      been considering equipping works of our own, but I am afraid they are not
      going to materialize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can handle anything,&rdquo; and from sheer force of habit he was all
      enthusiasm. He had pleasant visions of the shops running over-time, and
      everybody satisfied and happy. It made no difference to him that he would
      not be there to share in the general prosperity. With the start he had
      given it, the future of the Huckleberry would be assured. He decided he
      had better say nothing to Curtice about South America.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of this meeting was that he stuck to Curtice with a genial
      devotion that made him wax in his hands. They spent two days together,
      inspecting paintless and tattered day coaches, and on the third day Dan
      strolled from his friend's office buttoning his coat on a contract that
      would mean many thousands of dollars for Antioch. It was altogether his
      most brilliant achievement. He felt that there only remained for him to
      turn the Huckleberry over to Holloway and leave the country. He had done
      well by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan had been in Chicago about three weeks, when at last Holloway returned,
      and he proved as limp as Cornish had said he would be in a crisis. He was
      inclined to be critical, too, and seemed astonished that Oakley had been
      waiting in Chicago to see him. He experienced a convenient lapse of memory
      when the latter mentioned his telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't accept your resignation,&rdquo; he said, fussing nervously among the
      papers on his desk. &ldquo;I didn't put you at Antioch; that was General
      Cornish's own idea, and I don't know what he'll think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has gotten past the point where I care what he thinks,&rdquo; retorted Dan,
      curtly. &ldquo;You must send some one else there to take hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you cable him instead of writing me?&rdquo; fretfully. &ldquo;I don't know
      what he will want, only it's pretty certain to be the very thing I sha'n't
      think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have cabled him if I had considered it necessary, but it never
      occurred to me that my resignation would not be agreed to on the spot, as
      my presence in Antioch only widens the breach and increases the difficulty
      of a settlement with the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did you leave in charge?&rdquo; inquired Holloway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's Kerr's assistant,&rdquo; Dan explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you leave Kerr in charge?&rdquo; demanded the vice-president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laid him off,&rdquo; said Dan, in a tone of exasperation, and then he added,
      to forestall more questions: &ldquo;He was in sympathy with the men, and he
      hadn't the sense to keep it to himself. I couldn't be bothered with him,
      so I got rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must say you have made a frightful mess of the whole business,
      Oakley, but I told General Cornish from the first that you hadn't the
      training for the position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan turned very red in the face at this, but he let it pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad,&rdquo; murmured Holloway, still fingering the letters on the
      desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you are in doubt, why don't you cable General Cornish for
      instructions, or, if there is a reason why you don't care to, it is not
      too late for me to cable,&rdquo; said Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposal did not please Holloway at all, but he was unwilling to
      admit that he feared Cornish's displeasure, which, where he was concerned,
      usually took the form of present silence and a subsequent sarcasm that
      dealt with the faulty quality of his judgment. The sarcasm might come six
      months after it had been inspired, but it was certain to come sooner or
      later, and to be followed by a bad half-hour, which Cornish devoted to
      past mistakes. Indeed, Cornish's attitude towards him had become, through
      long association, one of chronic criticism, and he was certain to be
      unpleasantly affected both by what he did and by what he left undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you wait until the general returns from England? That's not far
      off now. Under the circumstances he'll accept your resignation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will have to,&rdquo; said Oakley, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry; he'll probably demand it,&rdquo; remarked the vice-president,
      disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are so sure of this, why don't you accept it?&rdquo; retorted Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no one to appoint in your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong with Holt? He'll do temporarily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't feel positive of his being satisfactory to General Cornish.
      He's a very young man, ain't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose you'd call him a young man, but he has been with the road
      for a long time, and has a pretty level head. I have found him very
      trustworthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have much greater confidence in Kerr. He's quiet and
      conservative, and he's had an excellent training with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you can get him. He is doing nothing, and will be glad to
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have probably succeeded in antagonizing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; with sudden cheerfulness. &ldquo;It was a hardship not to be able
      to give him a sound thrashing. That's what he deserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holloway looked shocked. The young man was displaying a recklessness of
      temper which was most unseemly and entirely unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it will be well for you to think it over, Oakley, before you
      conclude to break with General Cornish. To go now will be rather shabby of
      you, and you owe him fair treatment. Just remember it was those reforms of
      yours that started the strike, in the first place. I know&mdash;I know.
      What you did you did with his approval The men are peaceable enough, ain't
      they?&rdquo; and he glared at Oakley with mingled disfavor and weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody can handle them but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be long until they are begging you to open the shops. They will
      be mighty sick of the trouble they've shouldered when their money is all
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will never come to me for that, Mr. Holloway,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;I think
      they would, one and all, rather starve than recognize my position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll have to. We'll make them. We mustn't let them think we are
      weakening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't appreciate the feeling of intense hostility they have for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course the murder of that man&mdash;what was his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ryder, you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was unfortunate. I don't wonder you have some feeling about going back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vice-president was wonderfully moderate in his choice of words. He
      added: &ldquo;But it is really best for the interest of those concerned that you
      should go and do what you can to bring about a settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the sheerest idiocy for me to attempt it. The town may go
      hungry from now till the end of its days, but it won't have me at any
      price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always told Cornish he should sell the road the first opportunity he
      got. He had the chance once and you talked him out of it. Now you don't
      want to stand by the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Oakley, rising. &ldquo;I want to see an understanding reached with
      the men, and I am going to do what I can to help along. You will please to
      consider that I have resigned. I don't for the life of me see how you can
      expect me to show my face in Antioch,&rdquo; and with that he stalked from the
      place. He was thoroughly angry. He heard Holloway call after him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't accept your resignation. You'll have to wait until you see
      Cornish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan strode out into the street, not knowing what he would do. He was
      disheartened and exasperated at the stand Holloway had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently his anger moderated and his pace slackened. He had been quite
      oblivious to what was passing about him, and now for the first time, above
      the rattle of carts and trucks, he heard the newsboys shrilly calling an
      extra. He caught the words, &ldquo;All about the big forest fire!&rdquo; repeated over
      and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought a paper and opened it idly, but a double-leaded head-line
      arrested his attention. It was a brief special from Buckhom Junction. He
      read it with feverish interest. Antioch was threatened with complete
      destruction by the forest fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the first train for Antioch. Have you seen this?&rdquo; and he held
      out the crumpled page he had just torn from his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holloway glanced up in astonishment at this unlooked-for change of heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you'd conclude it was no way to treat General Cornish,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang Cornish! It's not on his account I'm going. The town is in a fair
      way to be wiped off the map. Here, read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he thrust the paper into Holloway's hands. &ldquo;The woods to the north and
      west of Antioch have been blazing for two days. They have sent out call
      after call for help, and apparently nobody has responded yet. That's why I
      am going back, and for no other reason.&rdquo;

      Junction, Joe Durks, who combined the duties of telegraph operator with
      those of baggage-master and ticket-agent, was at his table receiving a
      message when Dan Oakley walked into the office. He had just stepped from
      the Chicago express.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the latest word from Antioch, Joe?&rdquo; he asked, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Mr. Oakley? I got Antioch now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are asking help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The metallic clicking of the instrument before him ceased abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong, anyhow?&rdquo; He pushed back his chair and came slowly to his
      feet His finger was still on the key. He tried again to call up Antioch.
      &ldquo;They are cut off. I guess the wire is down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men stared at each other in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan's face was white in the murky, smoky twilight that filled the room.
      Durks looked anxious&mdash;the limit of his emotional capacity. He was a
      lank, colorless youth, with pale yellow tobacco stains about the corners
      of his mouth, and a large nose, which was superior to its surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakley broke silence with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's gone through to-day, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing's gone through on the B. &amp; A. There's nothing to send from
      this end of the line,&rdquo; the operator answered, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What went through yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing yesterday, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is No. 7?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's down at Harrison, Mr. Oakley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And No. 9?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's at Harrison, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what they are doing at Harrison?&rdquo; demanded Oakley, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed criminal negligence that no apparent effort had as yet been made
      to reach Antioch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; said Durks, laconically, biting his nails. &ldquo;I suppose they are
      waiting for the fire to burn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you know?&rdquo; persisted Dan, tartly. His displeasure moved the
      operator to a fuller explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was cut off yesterday morning. The last word I got was that No. 7 was
      on a siding there, and that No. 9, which started at 8.15 for Antioch, had
      had to push back. The fire was in between Antioch and Harrison, on both
      sides of the track, and blazing to beat hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having reached this verbal height, he relapsed into comparative
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the freight?&rdquo; questioned Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last I heard it was trying to make Parker's Run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was yesterday morning, too. It had come up that far from Antioch the
      day before to haul out four carloads of ties. Holt gave the order. It is
      still there, for all I know&mdash;that is, if it ain't burned or ditched.
      I sent down the extra men from the yards here to help finish loading the
      cars. I had Holt's order for it, and supposed he knew what was wanted.
      They ain't come back, but they got there ahead of the freight all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley felt this care for a few hundred dollars' worth of property to have
      been unnecessary, in view of the graver peril that threatened Antioch.
      Still, it was not Durks's fault. It was Holt who was to blame. He had
      probably lost his head in the general alarm and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Harrison might be menaced by the fire, it was in a measure protected
      by the very nature of its surroundings. But with Antioch, where there was
      nothing to stay the progress of the flames, the case was different. With a
      north wind blowing, they could sweep over the town unhindered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday the wind shifted a bit to the west, and for a while they
      thought Antioch was out of danger,&rdquo; said Durks, who saw what was in
      Oakley's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you heard from the other towns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're deserted. Everybody's gone to Antioch or Harrison. There was
      plenty of time for that, and when No. 7 made her last run, I wired ahead
      that it was the only train we could send out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get the extra men to Parker's Rim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baker took 'em there on the switch engine. I sent him down again this
      morning to see what was the matter with the freight, but he only went to
      the ten-mile fill and come back. He said he couldn't go any farther. I
      guess he wasn't so very keen to try. He said he hadn't the money put by
      for his funeral expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me up above that the M. &amp; W. had hauled a relief train for
      Antioch. What has been done with it? Have you made an effort to get it
      through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Durks looked distressed. Within the last three days flights of inspiration
      and judgment had been demanded of him such as he hoped would never be
      required again. And for forty-eight hours he had been comforting himself
      with the thought that about everything on wheels owned by the Huckleberry
      was at the western terminus of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't much of a relief train, Mr. Oakley. Two cars, loaded with
      fire-engines and a lot of old hose. They are on the siding now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were any men sent here with the relief train?&rdquo; questioned Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Antioch just wanted hose and engines. The water's played out, and
      they got to depend on the river if the fire strikes the town. They're in
      pretty bad shape, with nothing but one old hand-engine. You see, their
      water-mains are about empty and their hose-carts ain't worth a damn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley turned on his heel and strode from the office. The operator
      followed him. As they gained the platform Dan paused. The very air was
      heavy with smoke. The sun was sinking behind a blue film. Its dull disk
      was the color of copper. He wondered if the same sombre darkness was
      settling down on Antioch. The element of danger seemed very real and
      present. To Dan this danger centred about Constance Emory. He quite
      overlooked the fact that there were several thousand other people in
      Antioch. Durks, at his side, rubbed the sandy bristles on his chin with
      the back of his hand, and tried to believe he had thought of everything
      and had done everything there was to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woods were on fire all about the Junction, but the town itself was in
      no especial danger, as cultivated fields intervened to shut away the
      flames. In these fields Dan could see men and women busy at work tearing
      down fences. On a hillside a mile off a barn was blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes Warrick's barn,&rdquo; remarked the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the last word from Antioch? Do you remember exactly what was
      said?&rdquo; asked Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The message was that a strong north wind was blowing, and that the town
      was pretty certain to burn unless the engines and hose reached there
      tonight; but they have been saying that for two days, and the wind's
      always changed at the right moment and driven the fire back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan glanced along the track, and saw the relief train, consisting of an
      engine, tender, and two flatcars, loaded with hose and fire-engines, on
      one of the sidings. He turned on Durks with an angry scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven't you tried to start that train through? It's ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one is here to go with it, Mr. Oakley. I was sort of counting on the
      freight crew for the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Baker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went home on the 6. 10. He lives up at Car-son, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the first stop on the M. &amp; W. east of Buckhom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you let him leave? Great God, man! Do you mean to say that he's
      been loafing around here all day with his hands in his pockets? He'll
      never pull another throttle for the Huckleberry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Durks did not attempt to reply to this explosion of wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who made up the train?&rdquo; demanded Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baker did. Him and his fireman. I didn't know but the freight might come
      up from Parker's Run, and I wanted to be fixed for 'em. I couldn't do a
      thing with Baker. I told him his orders were to try and reach Antioch with
      the relief train, but he said he didn't care a damn who gave the order, he
      wasn't going to risk his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dan had lost interest in Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You must get a fireman for me, and I'll take out
      the train myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wondered why he had not thought of this before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I'll manage to reach Antioch,&rdquo; he added, as he ran across to the
      siding and swung himself into the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faded blue blouse and a pair of greasy overalls were lying on the seat
      in the cab. He removed his coat and vest and put them on. Durks, who had
      followed him, climbed up on the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to run slow, Mr. Oakley, because it's likely the heat has
      spread the rails, if it ain't twisted them loose from the ties,&rdquo; he
      volunteered. For answer Oakley thrust a shovel into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, throw in some coal,&rdquo; he ordered, opening the furnace door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Durks turned a sickly, mottled white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't leave,&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You idiot. You don't suppose I'd take you from your post. What I want you
      to do is to help me get up steam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The operator attacked the coal on the tender vigorously. He felt an
      immense sense of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan's railroad experience covered nearly every branch. So it chanced that
      he had fired for a year prior to taking an office position. Indeed, his
      first ambition had been to be an engineer. It was now quite dark, and, the
      fires being raked down, he lit a torch and inspected his engine with a
      comprehensive eye. Next he probed a two-foot oiler into the rods and
      bearings and filled the cups. He found a certain pleasure in the fact that
      the lore of the craft to which he had once aspired was still fresh in his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baker keeps her in apple-pie order, Joe,&rdquo; he observed, approvingly. The
      operator nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's always tinkering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's done tinkering for us, unless I land in a ditch to-night, with
      the tender on top of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A purring sound issued from the squat throat of the engine. It was sending
      aloft wreaths of light gray smoke and softly spitting red-hot cinders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan climbed upon the tender and inspected the tank. Last of all he went
      forward and lit the headlight, and his preparations were complete. He
      jumped down from the cab, and stood beside Joe on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully, &ldquo;where's that fireman, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone home, Mr. Oakley. He lives at Car-son, too, same as Baker,&rdquo;
       faltered the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there's another man whose services we won't require in future. We'll
      have to find some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you can,&rdquo; ventured Durks, reluctantly. Instinct told him
      that this opinion would not tend to increase his popularity with Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They just won't want to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that they will allow Antioch to burn and not lift
      a hand to save the town?&rdquo; he demanded, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He couldn't believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, there won't any one here want to get killed; and they will
      think they got enough trouble of their own to keep them home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can go up-town and see if we can't find a man who thinks of more than
      his own skin,&rdquo; said Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, we can try,&rdquo; agreed Durks, apathetically, but his tone implied
      an unshaken conviction that the search would prove a fruitless one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you think of any one who would like to make the trip?&rdquo; Durks was
      thoughtful. He thanked his lucky stars that the M. &amp; W. paid half his
      salary. At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't, Mr. Oakley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound like the crunching of cinders underfoot on the other
      side of the freight car near where they were standing, but neither Durks
      nor Oakley heard it. The operator's jaws worked steadily in quiet animal
      enjoyment of their task. He was still canvassing the Junction's adult male
      population for the individual to whom life had become sufficiently
      burdensome for Oakley's purpose. Dan was gazing down the track at the red
      blur in the sky. Back of that ruddy glow, in the path of the flames, lay
      Antioch. The wind was in the north. He was thinking, as he had many times
      in the last hour, of Constance and the Emorys. In the face of the danger
      that threatened he even had a friendly feeling for the rest of Antioch. It
      had been decent and kindly in its fashion until Ryder set to work to ruin
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew he might ride into Antioch on his engine none the worse for the
      trip, except for a few bums, but there was the possibility of a more
      tragic ending. Still, whatever the result, he would have done his full
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      He faced Durks again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any man who knows enough to shovel coal will do,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no one will want to take such long chances, Mr. Oakley. Baker said it
      was just plain suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; and Dan swore like a brakeman out of temper, in the bad,
      thoughtless manner of his youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment a heavy, slouching figure emerged from the shadow at
      the opposite end of the freight car, and came hesitatingly towards the two
      men. Then a voice said, in gentle admonition:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't swear so, Dannie. It ain't right. I'll go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was his father.

      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NTIOCH had grown
      indifferent to forest fires, They were of almost annual recurrence, and
      the town had come to expect them each fall. As the Hon. Jeb Barrows
      remarked, with cheerful optimism, voicing a popular belief, if it was
      intended Antioch should go that way it would have gone long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this summer the drought had been of longer duration than usual. The
      woods were like tinder, and the inevitable wadding from some careless
      hunter's gun, or the scattered embers from some camp-fire far up in the
      northern part of the State, had started a conflagration that was licking
      up miles of timber and moving steadily south behind a vast curtain of
      smoke that darkened half the State. It was only when the burned-out
      settlers from the north began to straggle in that Antioch awoke to a
      proper sense of its danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick upon the heels of these fugitives came the news that the half-dozen
      families at Barrow's Saw Mills had been forced to flee from their homes.
      The fire had encircled the mills in a single night, and one old man, a
      trapper and hunter, who lived alone in a cabin in a small clearing on the
      outskirts of the settlement, had been burned to death in his bunk before
      he could be warned of his danger or help reach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Antioch sent out its first call for help. It needed
      fire-engines and hose, and it needed them badly, especially the hose, for
      the little reservoir from which the town drew its water supply was almost
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antioch forgot the murder of Ryder. It forgot Roger Oakley, the strike,
      and all lesser affairs. A common danger threatened its homes, perhaps the
      lives of its citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      A score of angry men were stamping up and down the long platform across
      from the shops, or pushing in and out of the ugly little depot, which had
      taken on years in apparent age and decay in the two days during which no
      trains had been running.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were abusing Holt, the railroad, and every one connected with it. For
      the thousandth time they demanded to know where the promised relief train
      was&mdash;if it had started from Buckhorn Junction, and, if it <i>hadn't</i>
      started, the reason of the delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harried assistant-treasurer answered these questions as best he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to let the town burn without making a move to save it?&rdquo;
       demanded an excited citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think I am any more anxious to see it go than you are?&rdquo;
       retorted Holt, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don't your damn road do something to prevent it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road's doing all it can, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a whole lot, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are cut off,&rdquo; said Holt, helplessly. &ldquo;Everything's tied up tight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can wire, can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can wire; I have wired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where's the relief train, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's at the Junction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to do us a lot of good there, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll send it as soon as they can get together a crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stir them up again, Holt Tell 'em we got to have that hose and those
      engines, or the town's gone. It's a matter of life and death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holt turned back into the depot, and the crowd dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the ticket-office he found McClintock, who had just come in from
      up-town. The master mechanic's face was unusually grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been investigating the water supply with the city engineer. Things
      are in awful shape. The mains are about empty, and there isn't pressure
      enough from the stand-pipe to throw a thirty-five foot stream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Oakley was here,&rdquo; muttered Holt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I. Somehow he had a knack at keeping things moving. I don't mean
      but what you've done your level best, Byron,&rdquo; he added, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've laid down on me at the Junction,&rdquo; said the younger man, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped to the door, mopping his face with his handkerchief, and stood
      looking down the track in the direction of Buckhorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They made it so Oakley couldn't stay, and now they wonder why the relief
      train is hung up. All Durks says is that he can't get a crew. I tell you
      if Oakley was here he'd <i>have</i> to get one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a mistake to send the yard engine up to Parker's Run. If we had it
      here now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in hell was <i>I</i> to know we'd need it? I had to try to save those
      ties, and we thought the wind was shifting into the south,&rdquo; in fierce
      justification of his course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so, all right,&rdquo; said McClintock. &ldquo;We did think the danger was
      past; only we shouldn't have taken any chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point they were joined by Dr. Emory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything new from Buckhorn?&rdquo; he inquired, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's the same old story. Durks ain't got anybody to send.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn his indifference!&rdquo; muttered McClintock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, like Holt, fell to mopping his face with his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't he know our danger? Don't he know we can't fight the fire without
      engines and hose?&mdash;that our water supply is about exhausted, and that
      we'll have to depend on the river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holt nodded wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks as though we were to be left to face this situation as best we
      can, without help from the outside,&rdquo; said the doctor, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holt turned to McClintock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't there some method of back-firing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too late to try that, and, with this wind blowing, it would have
      been too big a risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced moodily across the town to the north, where the black cloud
      hung low in the sky. He added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told my wife to keep the young ones in, no matter what happens.
      But Lord! they will be about as well off one place as another, when it
      comes to the pinch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; agreed the doctor. &ldquo;I am at a loss to know what
      precautions to take to insure the safety of Mrs. Emory and my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only four o'clock, but it was already quite dark in the town&mdash;a
      strange half-light that twisted the accustomed shape of things. The air
      was close, stifling; and the wind, which blew in heavy gusts, was like the
      breath from a furnace. The sombre twilight carried with it a horrible
      sense of depression. Every sound in nature was stilled; silence reigned
      supreme. It was the expectant hush of each living thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men stepped out on the platform. Holt and the doctor were still
      mopping their faces with their limp handkerchiefs. McClintock was fanning
      himself with his straw hat. When they spoke they unconsciously dropped
      their voices to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those families in the North End should move out of their homes,&rdquo; said the
      doctor. &ldquo;If they wait until the fire gets here, they will save nothing but
      what they have on their backs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the houses ought to come down,&rdquo; added McClintock. &ldquo;There's where
      the fire will get its first grip on the town, and then Heaven help us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Night came, and so imminent seemed the danger that Antioch was roused to
      something like activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd, composed almost exclusively of men, gathered early on the square
      before the court-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had by common consent given up all hope that the relief train would
      be sent from Buckhom Junction. The light in the sky told them that they
      were completely cut off from the outside world. The town and the woods
      immediately adjacent formed an island in the centre of an unbroken sea of
      fire. The ragged red line had crept around to the east, west, and south,
      but the principal danger would be from the north, where the wind drove the
      flames forward with resistless fury. To the south and east Billup's Fork
      interposed as a barrier to the progress of the fire, and on the west was a
      wide area of cultivated fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      At regular intervals waves of light flooded the square, as the freshening
      gusts fanned the conflagration or whirled across the town great patches of
      black smoke. In the intervals of light a number of dark figures could be
      seen moving about on the roof of the court-house. Like the square below,
      it was crowded with anxious watchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd jostled to and fro on the square, restless and excited, and
      incapable of physical quiet. Then suddenly a voice was raised and made
      itself heard above the tramp of feet. &ldquo;Those houses in the North End must
      come down!&rdquo; this voice said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence, and then a many-tongued murmur. Each man present knew
      that the residents of the North End had sworn that they would not
      sacrifice their homes to the public good. If their homes must go, they
      much preferred to have them burn, for then the insurance companies would
      have to bear the loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Those houses must come down!&rdquo; the voice repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was McClintock who had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's going to pull them down?&rdquo; another voice asked. &ldquo;They are ready to
      fight for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we ought to be just as ready to fight, if it comes to that,&rdquo; answered
      the master mechanic. &ldquo;It's for the common good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd was seized with a noisy agitation. Its pent-up feelings found
      vent in bitter denunciation of the North End. A man&mdash;it was the Hon.
      Jeb Barrows&mdash;had mounted the court-house steps, and was vainly
      endeavoring to make himself heard. He was counselling delay, but no one
      listened to him. The houses must be torn down whether their owners wanted
      it or not. McClintock turned up the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fall in!&rdquo; he shouted, and at least a hundred men fell in behind him,
      marching two abreast. Here and there, as they moved along, a man would
      forsake the line to disappear into his own gate. When he rejoined his
      neighbors he invariably carried an axe, pick, or crowbar.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the square they turned into Main Street, and from Main Street into
      the north road, and presently the head of the procession halted before a
      cluster of small frame houses resting in a hollow to their right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These must come down first,&rdquo; said McClintock. &ldquo;Now we want no noise, men.
      We'll pass out their stuff as quietly as we can, and take it back to the
      square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swung open a gate as he spoke. &ldquo;Williams keeps a team. A couple of you
      fellows run around to the barn and hook up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the front door opened, and Williams himself appeared on the
      threshold. A dog barked, other doors opened, lights gleamed in a score of
      windows, and the North End threw off its cloak of silence and darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet, and let me do the talking,&rdquo; said McClintock over his
      shoulder. Then to the figure in the doorway:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have come to help you move, John. I take it you will be wanting to
      leave here shortly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell you have!&rdquo; responded Williams, roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll give you a hand!&rdquo; and the master mechanic pushed through the gate
      and took a step down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Williams, swinging out an arm. &ldquo;I got something to say
      about that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound as of the clicking, of a lock, and he presented the
      muzzle of a shot-gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, say,&rdquo; said McClintock, gently; &ldquo;you had better not try to use that.
      It will only make matters worse. Your house has got to come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell it has!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said McClintock, still gently. &ldquo;We got to save what we can of the
      town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Williams made no answer to this, but McClintock saw him draw the butt of
      the gun up towards his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men at his back were perfectly still. They filled the street, and,
      breathing hard, pressed heavily against the picket fence, which bent
      beneath the weight of their bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better be reasonable. We are losing precious time,&rdquo; urged
      McClintock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to McClintock afterwards that there had been no great variety
      to Williams's remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour or two this place will be on fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got no kick coming if it burns, but it sha'n't be pulled down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put up your gun, and we'll give you a lift at getting your stuff out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McClintock kept his eyes on the muzzle of the shotgun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't the property loss we are thinking of&mdash;it's the possible
      loss of life,&rdquo; he said, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll chance it,&rdquo; retorted Williams, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Williams made no reply; he merely fingered the lock of his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put down that gun, John!&rdquo; commanded McClintock, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment he reached around and took an axe from the hands of the
      nearest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it down,&rdquo; he repeated, as he stepped quickly towards Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The listening men pressed heavily against the fence in their feverish
      anxiety to miss nothing that was said or done. The posts snapped, and they
      poured precipitously into the yard. At the same moment the gun exploded,
      and a charge of buckshot rattled harmlessly along the pavement at
      McClintock's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then succeeded a sudden pause, deep, breathless, and intense, and then the
      crowd gave a cry&mdash;a cry that was in answer to a hoarse cheer that had
      reached them from the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant later the trampled front yard was deserted by all save Williams
      in the doorway. He still held the smoking gun to his shoulder.

      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Roger Oakley
      appeared on the platform at Buckhom Junction, Durks started violently,
      while Dan took a quick step forward and placed a warning hand on the old
      convict's arm. He feared what he might say. Then he said to the operator:
      &ldquo;He'll do. Go see if you can get Antioch. Try just once more. If you
      succeed, tell them the engines and hose will be there within an hour, or
      they need not look for them. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Oakley.&rdquo; And Durks moved up the platform with alacrity. He
      was relieved of one irksome responsibility. He had his own theories as to
      who the stranger was, but he told himself it was none of his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was out of hearing, Dan turned to his father, and said,
      earnestly: &ldquo;Look here, daddy, I can't allow you to do it. We are neither
      of us popular. It's bad enough for me to have to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can't you allow it, Dannie?&rdquo; And his son recognized the same cheerful
      tone with which he had always met and overruled his objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will end in your arrest, and we don't want that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's more than likely I'll be arrested sooner or later, anyhow,&rdquo; he said,
      with a suggestion of weariness, as if this were a matter it was a waste of
      time to consider. &ldquo;The Lord has set His face against me. It's His wish I
      should return. I've been stubborn and headstrong and wouldn't see it, but
      look there,&rdquo; and he nodded towards the red western sky. &ldquo;It's a summons. I
      got to obey, whether I want to or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be safe. No telling what they will do with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain't the question, Dannie; that ain't at all the question. It's not
      what they'll do to me,&rdquo; and he softly patted the hand that rested on his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan saw that his clothes hung loosely to his mighty frame. They were torn
      and stained. He had the appearance of a man who had endured hardship,
      privation, and toil. His glance was fugitive and anxious. &ldquo;Where have you
      been all this while?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Not here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have been living in the woods, trying to escape from the country,
      and the fires wouldn't let me. Wherever I went, they were there ahead of
      me, driving me back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you kill him? How did it happen?&rdquo; Dan added. &ldquo;Or is it all a
      mistake? Did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile faded from the old convict's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a sort of accident, and it was sort of carelessness, Dannie,&rdquo; he
      explained, with a touch of sullenness. &ldquo;I hit him&mdash;not hard, mind
      you. I know I shouldn't have done it, but he was in the wrong, and he
      wouldn't listen to reason. I don't know when I ever seen a man so set in
      his wickedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you want to go back. Do you know what it means if you are
      arrested? Have you thought of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley waved the query aside as though it concerned him not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be with you,&rdquo; he said, wistfully. &ldquo;You may not get through
      alive, and I want to be with you. You'll need me. There's no one you can
      trust as you can me, for I won't fail you, no matter what the danger is.
      And there's the girl, Dannie. Have you thought of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan set his lips. &ldquo;My God, I can't think of anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Dan, thrusting his hands into his pockets. &ldquo;I am going to
      give you what money I have. It isn't much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for, Dannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure to be seen and recognized if you stay about here. Your
      description has been telegraphed all over the State. For that reason I'll
      take you with me part way. Then I'll slow up, and you can hide again. It's
      your only chance. I am sorry I can't do more for you. I wish I could; but
      perhaps we can arrange to meet afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father smiled with the unconscious superiority of the man who firmly
      believes he is controlled by an intelligence infinitely wise and beyond
      all human conception. No amount of argument could have convinced him that
      Providence was not burning millions of feet of standing timber and an
      occasional town solely for his guidance. In his simple seriousness he saw
      nothing absurd nor preposterous in the idea. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've wanted to escape, Dannie, for your sake, not for mine. But when I
      seen you to-night I knew the Lord intended we should keep together. He
      didn't bring us here for nothing. That ain't His way. There's no one to go
      with you but me, and you can't go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&mdash;I will!&rdquo; And Dan swore under his breath. He realized that no
      word of his could move his father. He would carry his point, just as he
      always had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Durks came running along the platform from the dépôt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use,&rdquo; shaking his head. &ldquo;The wire's down. Say, you want to keep
      your eyes open for the freight. It may be on the siding at Parker's Run,
      and it may be on the main track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan made a last appeal to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you listen to what I say?&rdquo; sinking his voice to a hoarse whisper.
      &ldquo;They'll hang you&mdash;do you hear? If ever they lay hands on you they
      will show no mercy!&rdquo; It did not occur to him that his father would be
      returning under circumstances so exceptional that public sentiment might
      well undergo a radical change in his favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley merely smiled as he answered, with gentle composure: &ldquo;I don't
      think we need to worry about that. We are in His hands, Dannie,&rdquo; and he
      raised his face to the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; he said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll throw the switch for you!&rdquo; and the operator ran down the track. He
      was quite positive he should never see Oakley again, and he felt something
      akin to enthusiasm at the willing sacrifice of his life which he conceived
      him to be making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father and son stepped to the engine. The old convict mounted heavily to
      his post, and Dan sprang after him, his hand groping for the throttle
      lever. There was the hiss of steam, and Joe cried from the darkness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, come ahead!&rdquo; And the engine, with its tender and two cars,
      began its hazardous journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they slipped past him, the operator yelled his good-bye, and Dan pushed
      open the cab window and waved his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley, on the narrow iron shelf between the engine and the tender,
      was already throwing coal into the furnace. His face wore a satisfied
      expression. Apparently he was utterly unmoved by the excitement of the
      moment, for he bent to his work as if it were the most usual of tasks, and
      the occasion the most commonplace. He had taken off his coat and vest and
      had tossed them up on the tender out of his way. Dan, looking over the
      boiler's end, could see his broad shoulders and the top of his head. He
      leaned back with his hand on the throttle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old convict straightened up instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Dannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going with me? You are determined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we settled that, Dannie, before we started,&rdquo; he said,
      pleasantly, but there was a shrewd, kindly droop to the corners of his
      mouth, for he appreciated his victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know, because if I am to slow up for you I'll have to do it
      soon, or I'll be leaving you in worse shape than I found you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this his father made no direct reply. Instead he asked, &ldquo;Do you think
      we'll reach Antioch in time to do them any good?&rdquo; Dan faced about.
    </p>
    <p>
      They slid into a straight stretch of road beyond the Junction, and the
      track shone yellow far ahead, where the engine looked down upon it with
      its single eye. Each minute their speed increased. A steady jarring and
      pounding had begun that grew into a dull and ponderous roar as the engine
      rushed forward. Dan kept a sharp watch for the freight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Durks had said, it might be on the siding at Parker's Rim, and it might
      not. In the latter event, his and his father's troubles would soon be at
      an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his seat and went to the door of the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll take it easy for the first ten miles or so, then we'll be in the
      fire, and that will be our time to hit her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley nodded his acquiescence. In what he conceived to be worldly
      matters he was quite willing to abide by Dan's judgment, for which he had
      profound respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fast are we going?&rdquo; he asked. Dan steadied himself and listened, with
      a finger on his pulse, until he caught the rhythmic swing of the engine,
      as it jarred from one rail to another. Then he said: &ldquo;Twenty-five miles an
      hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't very fast, is it, Dannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was evidently disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll do twice that presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old convict looked relieved. They were running now with a strip of
      forest on one side of the track and cultivated fields on the other, but
      with each rod they covered they were edging in nearer the flames. At
      Parker's Rim the road crossed a little stream which doubled back in the
      direction of Buckhorn Junction. There was nothing after that to stay the
      progress of the fire, and the rest of their way lay through the blazing
      pine-woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before they reached the ten-mile fill they came to the strip of
      burned timber that had sent Baker back to Buckhorn earlier in the day.
      Here and there a tree was still blazing, but for the most part the fire
      had spent its strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they swung past Parker's Run a little farther on, Dan saw the freight,
      or, rather, what was left of it, on the siding. It had been cutting out
      four flat-cars loaded with ties, and he understood the difficulty at a
      glance. On the main track a brick-and-stone culvert spanned the Run, but
      the siding crossed it on a flimsy wooden bridge. This bridge had probably
      been burning as the freight backed in for the flatcars, and when it
      attempted to pull out the weakened structure had collapsed and the engine
      had gone through into the cut. It rested on its forward end, jammed
      between the steep banks, with its big drivers in the air. Of the cars
      there remained only the trucks and iron work. Near by a tool-shed had
      formerly stood, but that was gone, too. The wheels and gearing of a
      hand-car in the midst of a heap of ashes marked the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan turned to his father. &ldquo;Are you all right, daddy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Dannie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind your footing. It will be pretty shaky back there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were still in the burned district, where a change in the wind that
      afternoon had driven the fire back on itself. It had made a clean sweep of
      everything inflammable. Luckily the road had been freshly ballasted, and
      the track was in fair condition to resist the flames. But an occasional
      tie smouldered, and from these the rushing train thrashed showers of
      sparks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan kept his eyes fastened on the rails, which showed plainly in the jerky
      glare of the headlight It was well to be careful while care was possible.
      By-and-by he would have to throw aside all caution and trust to chance.
      Now he increased his speed, and the insistent thud of the wheels drowned
      every other sound, even the far-off roar of the flames. At his back, at
      intervals, a ruddy glow shot upward into the night, when Roger Oakley
      threw open the furnace door to pass in coal. Save for this it was still
      quite dark in the cab, where Dan sat with his hand on the throttle lever
      and watched the yellow streak that ran along the rails in advance of the
      engine. Suddenly the wall of light ahead brightened visibly, and its glare
      filled the cab. They were nearing the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan jammed the little window at his elbow open and put out his head. A hot
      blast roared past him, and the heat of the fire was in his face. He drew
      the window shut. It was light as day in the cab now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned across the boiler's end, and, with a hand to his lips, called to
      his father, &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man drew himself erect and crept nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that you say, Dannie?&rdquo; he asked. His face was black with coal-dust
      and grime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you all right? Can you bear the heat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am doing very nicely, but this ain't a patch on what it's going to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it will be much worse, though this is had enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can stand it. We must think of those poor people at Antioch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll stick to the engine as long as the engine sticks to the rails,&rdquo;
       said Dan, grimly. &ldquo;Hadn't you better come into the cab with me? You'll be
      frightfully exposed when we get into the thick of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, Dannie? I'll give you steam, and you drive her as hard as you
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, shovel in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, all in a second, and they were in the burning woods, rushing beneath
      trees that were blazing to their very summits. The track seemed to shake
      and tremble in the fierce light and fiercer heat. Burning leaves and
      branches were caught up to be whirled in fiery eddies back down the rails
      as the train tore along, for Dan was hitting her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tongues of fire struck across at the two men. Smoke and fine white ashes
      filled their mouths and nostrils. Their bodies seemed to bake. They had
      been streaming wet with perspiration a moment before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off in the forest it was possible to see for miles. Every tree and bush
      stood forth distinct and separate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Oakley put down his shovel for an instant to fill a bucket with
      water from the tank on the tender. He plunged his head and arms in it and
      splashed the rest over his clothes. Dan turned to him for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't far now,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Just around the next curve and we'll see
      the town, if it's still there, off in the valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old convict did not catch more than the half of what he said, but he
      smiled and nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they swung around the curve a dead sycamore, which the fire had girdled
      at the base, crashed across the track. The engine plunged into its top,
      rolled it over once and tossed it aside. There was the smashing of glass
      and the ripping of leather as the sycamore's limbs raked the cab, and
      Roger Oakley uttered a hoarse cry, a cry Dan did not hear, but he turned,
      spitting dust and cinders from his lips, and saw the old convict still
      standing, shovel in hand, in the narrow gangway that separated the engine
      and tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had set the whistle shrieking, and it cut high above the roar of the
      flames, for, off in the distance, under a canopy of smoke, he saw the
      lights of Antioch shining among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later and they were running smoothly through the yards, with
      the brakes on and the hiss of escaping steam. As they slowed up beside the
      depot, Dan sank down on the seat in the cab, limp and exhausted. He was
      vaguely conscious that the platform was crowded with people, and that they
      were yelling at him excitedly and waving their hats, but he heard their
      cries only indifferently well. His ears were dead to everything except the
      noise of his engine, which still echoed in his tired brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He staggered to his feet, and was about to descend from the cab, when he
      saw that his father was lying face down on the iron shelf between the
      engine and tender. He stooped and raised him gently in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old convict opened his eyes and looked up into his face, his lips
      parted as if he were about to speak, but no sound came from them.

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ONSTANCE EMORY and
      her mother, waiting quietly in their own home, heard the cheers when the
      noise from Dan's shrieking engine reached the crowd of desperate men on
      the square. Then presently they heard the rattle and clash of the
      fire-engines as they were dragged through the street, and were aware that
      the relief train had arrived, but it was not until the doctor came in some
      time long after midnight that they knew who had been the savior of the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over, dear. The fire is under control,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully,
      addressing his wife. &ldquo;I guess we can go to bed now and feel pretty sure we
      won't be burned out before morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance put down the book she had been trying to read, and rose tiredly
      and stiffly from her chair beside the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the train did come, after all?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, but not a moment too
      soon. I tell you we can't be grateful enough. I've been with Oakley and
      his father; that's what kept me,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oakley!&rdquo; Constance cried, in amazement. &ldquo;You don't mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Didn't you know that it was Oakley and his father who brought the
      relief train? The old man is dead. He was killed on the way. It's a
      miracle that either of them got through alive. Hadn't you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance put out her hands blindly, for a sudden mist had come before her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you don't mean that Mr. Oakley has returned to Antioch&mdash;that
      he is here now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it seems no one else would come. Oakley was in Chicago when he first
      heard of the fire, and started immediately for Buckhorn, where he found
      the relief train. Oddly enough, he found his father there, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there was something to the old man, after all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Emory,
      whose sympathies were as generous as they were easily aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good deal, I should say. He must have known that he was coming back to
      arrest and almost certain conviction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance's glance searched her father's face. She wanted to hear more of
      Oakley. Her heart was hungering for news of this man who had risked his
      life to save them. All her lingering tenderness&mdash;the unwilling growth
      of many days&mdash;was sweeping away the barriers of her pride. &ldquo;Mr.
      Oakley was not hurt?&rdquo; she questioned, breathlessly, pale to the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is pretty badly shaken up, and no wonder, but he will be all right in
      the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father turned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oakley&mdash;You look tired out, Constance. Do go to bed. I'll tell you
      all about it in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he now, papa?&rdquo; she questioned, going to his side and clasping
      her hands about his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down at the shop. They carried his father there from the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you have them bring him here?&rdquo; said Mrs. Emory, quickly.
      &ldquo;After this I won't listen to a word against either of them. I would like
      to show the town just how we feel in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggested it, but Oakley wouldn't hear to it. But don't worry about the
      town. It's gone wild. You should have seen the crowd on the platform when
      it saw Oakley in the engine-cab. It went stark mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Constance's eyes swam with tears. The strike, the murder of Ryder,
      the fire, had each seemed in turn a part of the tragedy of her life at
      Antioch, but Oakley's return was wholly glorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father added, &ldquo;I shall see Oakley in the morning, and learn if we can
      be of any service to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later, when Constance went to her own room, she drew forward a
      chair and seated herself by the window. Across the town, on the edge of
      the &ldquo;flats,&rdquo; she saw dimly the long, dark outline of the railroad shop,
      with its single tall chimney. She thought of Oakley as alone there keeping
      watch at the side of the grim old murderer, who had so splendidly redeemed
      himself by this last sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great clouds of black smoke were still rolling over the town, and the
      woods were still blazing fiercely in the distance. Beyond her window she
      heard the call of frightened birds, as they fluttered to and fro in the
      dull red light, and farther off, in the North End, the muffled throbbing
      of the fire-engines.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had had any doubts as to her feeling for Oakley, these doubts were
      now a thing of the past. She knew that she loved him. She had been petty
      and vain; she had put the small things of life against the great, and this
      was her punishment. She tried to comfort herself with the thought that she
      should see him in the morning; then she could tell him all. But what could
      she tell him? The time had gone by when she could tell him anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost morning when she undressed and threw herself down on her
      bed. She was disconsolate and miserable, and the future seemed quite
      barren of hope or happiness. Love had come to her, and she had not known
      its presence. Yes, she would tell Oakley that she had been little and
      narrow and utterly unworthy. He had cared for her, and perhaps he would
      understand. She fell asleep thinking this, and did not waken until her
      mother called her for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting for your father. He has gone down to see Mr. Oakley,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Emory said when she entered the dining-room. Constance glanced at the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he going to bring Mr. Oakley back with him?&rdquo; she asked, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He expected to. I declare, Constance, you look worn out. Didn't you sleep
      well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not very. I wonder if they are coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might go look,&rdquo; said her mother, and Constance hurried into the
      parlor. She was just in time to see her father enter the gate. He was
      alone. Constance flew to the front door and threw it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn't come?&rdquo; she cried, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a train was made up early this morning, and he has returned to
      Buckhorn&mdash;Why, what's the matter, Constance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Constance, with a little gasp of dismay, had slipped down into a
      chair, with her hands before her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; he questioned, anxiously. But she gave him no answer.
      She was crying softly, unrestrainedly. It was all over. Oakley was gone,
      and with him went her only hope of happiness. Yet more keen than her sense
      of pain and personal loss was her regret that he would never understand
      that she respected and admired him as he deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Constance, but I didn't know that you especially wanted to
      see him,&rdquo; said the doctor, awkwardly, but with a dawning comprehension of
      what it all meant. She made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. I wanted to tell him about something; that is all. It
      doesn't matter now.&rdquo; She glanced up into his face with a sudden doubt.
      &ldquo;You didn't see him&mdash;you are quite sure he went away without your
      seeing him&mdash;you are not deceiving me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, Constance, but he'll come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he won't, papa,&rdquo; shaking her head sadly. &ldquo;He's gone, and he will
      never come back. I know him better than you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she fled promptly up-stairs to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the nearest Constance came to betraying her love for Oakley. She
      was not much given to confidences, and the ideals that had sustained her
      in her pride now seemed so childish and unworthy that she had no wish to
      dwell upon them, but whenever Dan's name was mentioned in her presence she
      looked frightened and guilty and avoided meeting her father's glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, indeed, that. Oakley had taken final leave of Antioch. A new
      manager appeared and took formal charge of the destinies of the road.
      Under his direction work was resumed in the shops, for the strike had died
      a natural death. None of the hands were disposed to question the
      ten-per-cent cut, and before the winter was over the scale of wages that
      had been in force before the strike was inaugurated was voluntarily
      restored. The town had no criticisms to make of Johnson, the new manager,
      a quiet, competent official; the most any one said was that he was not
      Oakley. That was enough. For Dan had come into his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in October there was a flutter of excitement when Turner Joyce and
      his wife left for the East to be Oakley's guests. When they returned, some
      weeks later, they had a good deal to say about him that Antioch was
      frankly curious to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken his father to Burton, where his mother was buried. Afterwards
      he had joined General Cornish in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      While abroad, the financier had effected a combination of interests which
      grouped a number of roads under one management, and Dan had been made
      general superintendent of the consolidated lines, with his headquarters in
      New York City. The Joyces were but vaguely informed as to where these
      lines were, but they did full justice to their magnitude, as well as to
      the importance of Oakley's new connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dull monotony of those fall days in Antioch was never forgotten by
      Constance Emory. She was listless and restless by turns. She had hoped
      that she might hear from Oakley. She even thought the Joyces might bring
      her some message, but none had come. Dan had taken her at her word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had made no friends, and, with Ryder dead and Oakley gone, she saw. no
      one, and finally settled down into an apathy that alarmed the doctor. He,
      after some deliberation, suddenly announced his intention of going East to
      attend a medical convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you see Mr. Oakley?&rdquo; Constance asked, with quick interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably, if he's in New York when I get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance gave him a scared look and dropped her eyes. But when the time
      drew near for his departure, she followed him about as if there were
      something on her mind which she wished to tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day he started, she found courage to ask, &ldquo;Won't you take me with you,
      papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this time, dear,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quiet for a moment, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, you are not going to tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell who, Constance? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Oakley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Oakley, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him from under her long lashes while the color slowly
      mounted to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to tell him what you think you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would grant me the possession of ordinary sense, Constance. I
      am not quite a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a precious,&rdquo; she said, kissing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. What message shall I give Oakley for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't want to hear from me,&rdquo; shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he just won't, papa. Besides, I expect he has forgotten that such
      a person ever lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be too sure of that. What was the trouble, Constance? You'd
      better tell me, or I may say something I shouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must not say anything,&rdquo; in alarm. &ldquo;You must promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constance, what did Oakley say to you that last day he was here at the
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance's glance wandered meditatively from her father's face to the
      window and back again, while her color came and went. There was a faraway,
      wistful look in her eyes, and a sad little smile on her lips. At last she
      said, softly, &ldquo;Oh, he said a number of things. I can't remember now all he
      did say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Oakley tell you he cared for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance hesitated a moment, then, reluctantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, he did. And I let him go, thinking I didn't care for him,&rdquo;
       miserably, and with a pathetic droop of her lips, from which the smile had
      fled. &ldquo;I didn't know, and I have been so unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance left the room abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached New York, the first thing the doctor did was to look up
      Oakley. He was quick to notice a certain constraint in the young man's
      manner as they shook hands, but this soon passed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am awfully glad to see you,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;I have thought of you again
      and again, and I have been on the point of writing you a score of times. I
      haven't forgotten your kindness to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Oakley. I liked you, and it was a pleasure to me to be able to
      show my regard,&rdquo; responded the doctor, with hearty good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Mrs. Emory&mdash;and Miss Emory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are both very well. They were just a little hurt that you ran off
      without so much as a goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakley gave him a quick glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is&mdash;Miss Emory is still in Antioch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know but what she might be in the city with you,&rdquo; Dan explained,
      with evident disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't we ever going to see you in Antioch again?&rdquo; inquired the doctor.
      He put the question with studied indifference. Dan eagerly scanned his
      face. The doctor fidgeted awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> think I'd better go back?&rdquo; he asked, with a perceptible
      dwelling on the &ldquo;you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's face became a trifle red. He seemed to weigh the matter
      carefully; then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think you'd better. Antioch would like mightily to lay hands on
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan laughed happily. &ldquo;You don't suppose a fellow could dodge all that, do
      you? You see, I was going west to Chicago in a day or so, and I had
      thought to take a run on to Antioch. As a matter of fact, Cornish wants me
      to keep an eye on the shops. They are doing well, you know, and we don't
      want any falling off. But, you understand, I don't want to get let in for
      any fool hysterics,&rdquo; he added, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the supposed confidence in which telegrams are
      transmitted, Brown, the day man at Antioch, generally used his own
      discretion in giving publicity to any facts of local interest that came
      under his notice. But when he wrote off Dr. Emory's message, announcing
      that he and Oakley were in Chicago, and would arrive in Antioch the last
      of the week, he held it for several hours, not quite knowing what to do.
      Finally he delivered it in person, a sacrifice of official dignity that
      only the exigencies of the occasion condoned in his eyes. As he handed it
      to Mrs. Emory, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's from the doctor. You needn't be afraid to open it; he's all right.
      He'll be back Saturday night, and he's bringing Mr. Oakley with him. I
      came up to see if you had any objection to my letting the town know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Emory saw no reason why the knowledge of Oakley's return should be
      withheld, and in less than half an hour Antioch, with bated breath, was
      discussing the news on street corners and over back fences.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the town council met in secret session to consider the weighty
      matter of his reception, for by common consent it was agreed that the town
      must take official action. It was suggested that he be given the freedom
      of the city. This sounded large, and met with instant favor, but when the
      question arose as to how the freedom of the city was conferred, the
      president turned, with a slightly embarrassed air, to the member who had
      made the motion. The member explained, with some reserve, that he believed
      the most striking feature had to do with the handing over of the city keys
      to the guest of honor. But, unfortunately, Antioch had no city keys to
      deliver. The only keys that, by any stretch of the imagination, could be
      so called, were those of the court-house, and they were lost. Here an
      appeal was made to the Hon. Jeb Barrows, who was usually called in to
      straighten out any parliamentary tangles in which the council became
      involved. That eminent statesman was leaning dreamily against a pillar at
      the end of the council-chamber. On one of his cards he had already
      pencilled the brief suggestion: &ldquo;Feed him, and have out the band.&rdquo; He
      handed the card to the president, and the council heaved a sigh of relief.
      The momentous question of Oakley's official reception was settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dan and Dr. Emory stepped from No. 7 Saturday night the station
      platform was crowded with men and boys. The brass-band, which Antioch
      loved with a love that stifled criticism, perspiring and in dire haste,
      was turning the street corner half a block distant. Across the tracks at
      the railroad shops a steam-whistle shrieked an ecstatic welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan glanced at the doctor with a slightly puzzled air. &ldquo;What do you
      suppose is the matter?&rdquo; he asked, unsuspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, man, don't you understand? It's <i>you!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no need for him to say more, for the crowd had caught sight of
      Dan, and a hundred voices cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is! There's Oakley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in an instant Antioch, giving way to wild enthusiasm, was cheering
      itself black in the face, while above the sound of cheers and the crash of
      music, the steam-whistle at the shops shrieked and pealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood left Oakley's face. He looked down at the crowd and saw Turner
      Joyce. He saw McClintock and Holt and the men from the shops, who were, if
      possible, the noisiest of all. He turned helplessly to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's get out of this,&rdquo; he said between his teeth. The crowd and the
      noise and the excitement recalled that other night when he had ridden into
      Antioch. As he spoke he swung himself down from the steps of the coach,
      and the crowd closed about him with a glad shout of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor followed more slowly. As he gained the platform, the Hon. Jeb
      Barrows hurried to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he to go, Doc?&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;To your house, or to the hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then. The crowd's spoiling the whole business. I've got an
      address of welcome in my pocket that I was to have delivered, and there's
      to be a supper at the Rink to-night. Don't let him get away from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Dan had succeeded in extricating himself from the clutches of
      his friends, and was struggling towards a closed carriage at the end of
      the platform that he recognized as the Emorys'.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his haste and the dusk of the dull October twilight, he supposed the
      figure he saw in the carriage to be the doctor, who had preceded him, and
      called to the man on the box to drive home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he settled himself, he said, reproachfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you hadn't anything to do with this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slim, gloved hand was placed in his own, and a laughing voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up quickly, and found himself face to face with Constance
      Emory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence, and then Dan said, the courage that had
      brought him all the way to Antioch suddenly deserting him: &ldquo;It's too bad,
      isn't it? I had hoped I could slip in and out of town without any one
      being the wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can't,&rdquo; with a little air of triumph. &ldquo;Antioch is going to
      entertain you. It's been in a perfect furor of excitement ever since it
      knew you were coming back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose there is no help for it,&rdquo; resignedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is my father, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we left him behind,&rdquo; with sudden cheerfulness. He leaned forward
      so that he could look into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constance, I have returned because I couldn't stay away any longer. I
      tried to forget, but it was no use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had withdrawn her hand, but he had found it again, and now his fingers
      closed over it and held it fast He was feeling a sense of ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come to meet me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to meet papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you knew I was coming, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was too dark for him to see the color that was slowly mounting to her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constance, I don't believe you,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not sure you were coming,&rdquo; Constance said, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have known that I'd come back&mdash;that I couldn't stay away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think you have been a long time in making that discovery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, but when I saw your father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did papa say to you?&rdquo; with keen suspicion in her tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't blame him, Constance. It was not so much what he said as what
      he didn't say. I never knew any one to be quite so ostentatious about what
      was left unsaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constance freed her hand, and, shrinking into a corner, covered her face.
      She had a painful realization of the direction those confidences must have
      taken, between her father, who only desired her happiness, and the candid
      Oakley, who only desired her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there any use in my coming? You must be fair with me now. It's too
      serious a matter for you not to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I was not fair once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean that, but you have changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the better, Mr. Oakley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infinitely,&rdquo; with blunt simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't changed a scrap. You are just as rude as you ever were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan cast a hurried glance from the window. &ldquo;Constance, we won't have much
      more time to ourselves; we are almost home. Won't you tell me what I have
      come to hear&mdash;that you do care for me, and will be my wife? You know
      that I love you. But you mustn't send me from you a second time without
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't think you would care about me now. I wouldn't care about you
      if you had been as unworthy as I have been,&rdquo; her voice faltered. &ldquo;I might
      have shown you that I, too, could be brave, but I let the opportunity
      pass, and now, when everyone is proud&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I <i>do</i> care. I care a great deal, for I love you just as I have
      loved you from the very first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put out both her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had only looked back when you left the house that day you told me
      you cared&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Constance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at the window. I thought you'd surely look back, and then you would
      have known&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage had drawn up to the Emorys' gate. Dan jumped out and gave
      Constance his hand. Off in the distance they heard the band. Constance
      paused and rested her hand gently on Oakley's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! Do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish they'd stop their confounded nonsense,&rdquo; said Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can't stop them,&rdquo; delightedly. &ldquo;Antioch feels a sense of
      proprietorship. But do you hear the music, Dan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear. It's the band.&rdquo;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
